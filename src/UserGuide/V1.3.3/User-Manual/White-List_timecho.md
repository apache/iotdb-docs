```

**note**

1. If the white list itself is cancelled via the session client, the current connection is not immediately disconnected. It is rejected the next time the connection is created.
2. If white.list is modified directly, it takes effect within one minute. If modified via the session client, it takes effect immediately, updating the values in memory and the white.list disk file.
3. Enable the whitelist function, there is no white.list file, start the DB service successfully, however, all connections are rejected.
4. while DB service is running, the white.list file is deleted, and all connections are denied after up to one minute.
5. whether to enable the configuration of the white list function, can be hot loaded.
6. Use the Java native interface to modify the whitelist, must be the root user to modify, reject non-root user to modify; modify the content must be legal, otherwise it will throw a StatementExecutionException.
