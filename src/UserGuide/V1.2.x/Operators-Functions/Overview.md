# Overview

This chapter describes the operators and functions supported by IoTDB. IoTDB provides a wealth of built-in operators and functions to meet your computing needs, and supports extensions through the [User-Defined Function](./User-Defined-Function.md).

A list of all available functions, both built-in and custom, can be displayed with `SHOW FUNCTIONS` command.

See the documentation [Select-Expression](../Query-Data/Select-Expression.md) for the behavior of operators and functions in SQL.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning                   |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `+`      | positive (unary operator) |
| `-`      | negative (unary operator) |
| `*`      | multiplication            |
| `/`      | division                  |

### Logical Operators

| Operator                    | Meaning                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `NOT` / `!`                 | logical negation (unary operator) |
| `AND` / `&` / `&&`          | logical AND                       |
| `OR`/ &#124; / &#124;&#124; | logical OR                        |

For details and examples, see the document [Logical Operators](./Logical.md).

### Operator Precedence

The precedence of operators is arranged as shown below from high to low, and operators on the same row have the same precedence.

```sql
!, - (unary operator), + (unary operator)
*, /, DIV, %, MOD
-, +
=, ==, <=>, >=, >, <=, <, <>, !=
LIKE, REGEXP, NOT LIKE, NOT REGEXP
BETWEEN ... AND ..., NOT BETWEEN ... AND ...
IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
IN, CONTAINS, NOT IN, NOT CONTAINS
AND, &, &&
OR, |, ||
```

## Built-in Functions

The built-in functions can be used in IoTDB without registration, and the functions in the data quality function library need to be registered by referring to the registration steps in the next chapter before they can be used.

| MODE          | Find the mode. Note:  1.Having too many different values in the input series risks a memory exception;  2.If all the elements have the same number of occurrences, that is no Mode, return the value with earliest time;  3.If there are many Modes, return the Mode with earliest time. | All data Types                  | /                                                            | Consistent with the input data type |

## Data Quality Function Library

### About

For applications based on time series data, data quality is vital. **UDF Library** is IoTDB User Defined Functions (UDF) about data quality, including data profiling, data quality evalution and data repairing. It effectively meets the demand for data quality in the industrial field.

### Quick Start

The functions in this function library are not built-in functions, and must be loaded into the system before use.

1. [Download](https://archive.apache.org/dist/iotdb/1.0.1/apache-iotdb-1.0.1-library-udf-bin.zip) the JAR with all dependencies and the script of registering UDF.
2. Copy the JAR package to `ext\udf` under the directory of IoTDB system (Please put JAR to this directory of all DataNodes if you use Cluster).
3. Run `sbin\start-server.bat` (for Windows) or `sbin\start-server.sh` (for Linux or MacOS) to start IoTDB server.
4. Copy the script to the directory of IoTDB system (under the root directory, at the same level as `sbin`), modify the parameters in the script if needed and run it to register UDF.
