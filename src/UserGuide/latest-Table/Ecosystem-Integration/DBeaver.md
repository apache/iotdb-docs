# DBeaver

DBeaver is an SQL client and database management tool. It can interact with IoTDB using IoTDB's JDBC driver.

## 1. Install DBeaver

* Download DBeaver: https://dbeaver.io/download/

## 2. Install IoTDB

* Method 1: Download IoTDB binary release
  * Download: https://iotdb.apache.org/Download/
  * Version requirement: ≥ 2.0.1
* Method 2: Build from source
  * Source code: https://github.com/apache/iotdb
  * Follow compilation instructions in README.md or README_ZH.md


## 3. Connect IoTDB to DBeaver

1. Start the IoTDB service.

   ```shell
   ./sbin/start-server.sh
   ```
2. Launch DBeaver.

3. Create a new database connection:

   1. Go to `DBeaver > Database > New Database Connection`, or click the `"+"` icon in the top-left corner.

   3. Configure the connection based on your IoTDB model:(Username = Password = root)

      1. For Tree Model: Use the default Host method
