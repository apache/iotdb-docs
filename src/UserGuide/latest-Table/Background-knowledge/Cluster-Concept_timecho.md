# Common Concept

## SQL Dialect Related Concepts

### sql_dialect

IoTDB supports two time-series data models (SQL dialects), both managing devices and measurement points:  

- **Tree** **Model**: Organizes data in a hierarchical path structure, where each path represents a measurement point of a device.
- **Table** **Model**: Organizes data in a relational table format, where each table corresponds to a type of device.

Each dialect comes with its own SQL syntax and query patterns tailored to its data model.

### Schema  

Schema refers to the metadata structure of the database, which can follow either a tree or table format. It includes definitions such as measurement point names, data types, and storage configurations.

###  Device 

A device corresponds to a physical device in a real-world scenario, typically associated with multiple measurement points.

### Timeseries 

Also referred to as: physical quantity, time series, timeline, point, signal, metric, measurement value, etc.
A measurement point is a time series consisting of multiple data points arranged in ascending timestamp order. It typically represents a collection point that periodically gathers physical quantities from its environment. 

### Encoding        

Encoding is a compression technique that represents data in binary form, improving storage efficiency. IoTDB supports multiple encoding methods for different types of data. For details, refer to: [Compression and Encoding ](../Technical-Insider/Encoding-and-Compression.md)。

### Compression 

 After encoding, IoTDB applies additional compression techniques to further reduce data size and improve storage efficiency. Various compression algorithms are supported. For details, refer to: [ Compression and Encoding](../Technical-Insider/Encoding-and-Compression.md)。

## Distributed System Related Concepts

IoTDB supports distributed deployments, typically in a 3C3D cluster model (3 ConfigNodes, 3 DataNodes), as illustrated below:

### Key Concepts 

- **Nodes** (*ConfigNode,* *DataNode**, AINode*)
- **Regions** (*SchemaRegion, DataRegion*)
- **Replica Groups** 

Below is an introduction to these concepts.


### Nodes   

An IoTDB cluster consists of three types of nodes, each with distinct responsibilities:

- **ConfigNode (Management Node)** Manages cluster metadata, configuration, user permissions, schema, and partitioning. It also handles distributed scheduling and load balancing. All ConfigNodes are replicated for high availability.
- **DataNode (Storage and Computation Node)** Handles client requests, stores data, and executes computations.
- **AINode (Analytics Node)** Provides machine learning capabilities, allowing users to register pre-trained models and perform inference via SQL. It includes built-in time-series models and common ML algorithms for tasks like prediction and anomaly detection.

### Data Partitioning  

IoTDB divides schema and data into **Regions**, which are managed by DataNodes.

- **SchemaRegion**: Stores schema information (devices and measurement points). Regions with the same RegionID across different DataNodes serve as replicas.
- **DataRegion**: Stores time-series data for a subset of devices over a specified time period. Regions with the same RegionID across different DataNodes act as replicas.

For more details, see [Cluster Data Partitioning](../Technical-Insider/Cluster-data-partitioning.md)

### Replica Groups

Replica groups ensure high availability by maintaining multiple copies of schema and data. The recommended replication configurations are: 

| **Category** | **Configuration Item**    | **Standalone Recommended** | **Cluster Recommended** |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Metadata     | schema_replication_factor | 1                          | 3                       |
| Data         | data_replication_factor   | 1                          | 2                       |


## Deployment Related Concepts

IoTDB has two operation modes: standalone mode and cluster mode.

### Standalone Mode

An IoTDB standalone instance includes 1 ConfigNode and 1 DataNode, i.e., 1C1D.

- **Features**: Easy for developers to install and deploy, with low deployment and maintenance costs and convenient operations.  
- **Use Cases**: Scenarios with limited resources or low high-availability requirements, such as edge servers. 
- **Deployment Method**: [Stand-Alone Deployment](../Deployment-and-Maintenance/Stand-Alone-Deployment_timecho.md)


### Dual-Active Mode  

Dual-Active Deployment is a feature of TimechoDB, where two independent instances synchronize bidirectionally and can provide services simultaneously. If one instance stops and restarts, the other instance will resume data transfer from the breakpoint.  

> An IoTDB Dual-Active instance typically consists of 2 standalone nodes, i.e., 2 sets of 1C1D. Each instance can also be a cluster.  

- **Features**: The high-availability solution with the lowest resource consumption.  
- **Use Cases**: Scenarios with limited resources (only two servers) but requiring high availability.  
- **Deployment Method**: [Dual-Active Deployment](../Deployment-and-Maintenance/Dual-Active-Deployment_timecho.md)

### Cluster Mode

An IoTDB cluster instance consists of 3 ConfigNodes and no fewer than 3 DataNodes, typically 3 DataNodes, i.e., 3C3D. If some nodes fail, the remaining nodes can still provide services, ensuring high availability of the database. Performance can be improved by adding DataNodes.  

- **Features**: High availability, high scalability, and improved system performance by adding DataNodes.  
- **Use Cases**: Enterprise-level application scenarios requiring high availability and reliability.  
- **Deployment Method**: [Cluster Deployment](../Deployment-and-Maintenance/Cluster-Deployment_timecho.md)

| Scalability                 | Can expand DataNodes to improve performance              | Each instance can be scaled as needed                   | Can expand DataNodes to improve performance             |
| Performance                 | Can scale with the number of DataNodes                   | Same as one of the instances                            | Can scale with the number of DataNodes                  |

- Notes: The deployment steps for Stand-Alone Mode and Cluster Mode are similar (adding ConfigNodes and DataNodes one by one), with differences only in the number of replicas and the minimum number of nodes required to provide services.
