# Docker Deployment

## 1 Environment Preparation

### 1.1  Install Docker

```Bash
#Taking Ubuntu as an example. For other operating systems, you can search for installation methods on your own.
#step1: Install necessary system tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
#step2: Install GPG certificate
curl -fsSL https://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
#step3: Add the software source
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
#step4: Update and install Docker CE
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce
#step5: Set Docker to start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker
#step6: Verify if Docker is installed successfully
docker --version  #Display version information, indicating successful installation.
```

### 1.2 Install Docker Compose

```Bash
#Installation command
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ln -s  /usr/local/bin/docker-compose  /usr/bin/docker-compose
#Verify the installation
docker-compose --version  #Display version information, indicating successful installation.
```

## 2 Stand-Alone Deployment

This section demonstrates how to deploy a standalone Docker version of 1C1D.


### Pull Image File

The Docker image of Apache IoTDB has been uploaded tohttps://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iotdb。

Taking obtaining version 1.3.2 as an example, pull the image command:

```bash
docker pull apache/iotdb:1.3.2-standalone
```

View image:

```bash
docker images
```

![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E6%8B%89%E5%8F%96%E9%95%9C%E5%83%8F.png)

### 2.2 Create a Docker Bridge Network

```Bash
docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 --gateway=172.18.0.1  iotdb
```

### 2.3 Write the Docker-Compose YML File

Assume the IoTDB installation directory and the YML file are placed under the `/docker-iotdb` folder. The directory structure is as follows:`docker-iotdb/iotdb`, `/docker-iotdb/docker-compose-standalone.yml`

```Bash
docker-iotdb：
├── iotdb  #Iotdb installation directory
│── docker-compose-standalone.yml #YML file for standalone Docker Composer
```

The complete content of `docker-compose-standalone.yml` is as follows:

```Bash
version: "3"
services:
  iotdb-service:
    image: iotdb-enterprise:1.3.2.3-standalone #The image used
    hostname: iotdb
    container_name: iotdb
    restart: always       
    ports:
      - "6667:6667"
    environment:
      - cn_internal_address=iotdb
      - cn_internal_port=10710
      - cn_consensus_port=10720
      - cn_seed_config_node=iotdb:10710
      - dn_rpc_address=iotdb
      - dn_internal_address=iotdb
      - dn_rpc_port=6667
      - dn_internal_port=10730
      - dn_mpp_data_exchange_port=10740
      - dn_schema_region_consensus_port=10750
      - dn_data_region_consensus_port=10760
      - dn_seed_config_node=iotdb:10710
    privileged: true
    volumes:
        - ./iotdb/activation:/iotdb/activation
        - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
        - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
        - /usr/sbin/dmidecode:/usr/sbin/dmidecode:ro
        - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
    networks:
      iotdb:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.6
networks:
  iotdb:
    external: true
```

### 2.4 First Startup

Use the following command to start:

```Bash
cd　/docker-iotdb
docker-compose -f docker-compose-standalone.yml up
```


### 2.5 Verify the Deployment

- Viewing the log, the following words indicate successful startup

```SQL
docker logs -f iotdb-datanode #View log command
2024-07-21 08:22:38,457 [main] INFO  o.a.i.db.service.DataNode:227 - Congratulations, IoTDB DataNode is set up successfully. Now, enjoy yourself!
```

![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%AA%8C%E8%AF%81%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2.png)

- Enter the container to view the service running status and activation information 

View the launched container

```SQL
docker ps
```

![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%AA%8C%E8%AF%81%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B22.png)

Enter the container, log in to the database through CLI, and use the `show cluster` command to view the service status and activation status

```SQL
docker exec -it iotdb   /bin/bash        #Entering the container
./start-cli.sh -h iotdb                  #Log in to the database
IoTDB> show cluster                      #View status
```

You can see that all services are running and the activation status shows as activated.

### 2.6 Map the `/conf` Directory (Optional)


If you want to modify configuration files directly on the physical machine, you can map the `/conf` folder from the container. Follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Copy the `/conf` directory from the container to `/docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf`:

```Bash
docker cp iotdb:/iotdb/conf /docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf
```

**Step 2**: Add the mapping in `docker-compose-standalone.yml`:

```bash
    volumes:
        - ./iotdb/conf:/iotdb/conf   #Add mapping for this/conf folder
        - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
        - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
```

**Step 3**: Restart IoTDB:

```Bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose-standalone.yml  up  -d
```

## 3 Cluster Deployment

This section describes how to manually deploy a cluster consisting of 3 ConfigNodes and 3 DataNodes, commonly referred to as a 3C3D cluster.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/20240705141552.png" alt="" style="width: 60%;"/>
</div>

**Note: The cluster version currently only supports host and overlay networks, and does not support bridge networks.** 

Below, we demonstrate how to deploy a 3C3D cluster using the host network as an example.

### 3.1 Set Hostnames

Assume there are 3 Linux servers with the following IP addresses and service roles: 

| Node IP     | Hostname | Services             |
| :---------- | :------- | :------------------- |
| 192.168.1.3 | iotdb-1  | ConfigNode, DataNode |
| 192.168.1.4 | iotdb-2  | ConfigNode, DataNode |
| 192.168.1.5 | iotdb-3  | ConfigNode, DataNode |

On each of the 3 machines, configure the hostnames by editing the `/etc/hosts` file. Use the following commands:

```Bash
echo "192.168.1.3  iotdb-1"  >> /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.4  iotdb-2"  >> /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.5  iotdb-3"  >> /etc/hosts 
```

### 3.2 Load the Image File

The Docker image of Apache IoTDB has been uploaded tohttps://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iotdb。

Pull IoTDB images from three servers separately, taking version 1.3.2 as an example. The pull image command is:

```SQL
docker pull apache/iotdb:1.3.2-standalone
```

View image:

```SQL
docker images
```

![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%881.png)

### 3.3. Write the Docker-Compose YML Files

Here, we assume the IoTDB installation directory and YML files are placed under the `/docker-iotdb` folder. The directory structure is as follows:

```Bash
docker-iotdb：
├── confignode.yml #ConfigNode YML file 
├── datanode.yml   #DataNode YML file  
└── iotdb          #IoTDB installation directory 
```

On each server, create two YML files: `confignode.yml` and `datanode.yml`. Examples are provided below:

**confignode.yml：**

```Bash
#confignode.yml
version: "3"
services:
  iotdb-confignode:
    image: iotdb-enterprise:1.3.2.3-standalone #The image used
    hostname: iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
    container_name: iotdb-confignode
    command: ["bash", "-c", "entrypoint.sh confignode"]
    restart: always
    environment:
      - cn_internal_address=iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
      - cn_internal_port=10710
      - cn_consensus_port=10720
      - cn_seed_config_node=iotdb-1:10710   #The default first node is the seed node
      - schema_replication_factor=3         #Number of metadata copies
      - data_replication_factor=2           #Number of data replicas
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/activation:/iotdb/activation
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /usr/sbin/dmidecode:/usr/sbin/dmidecode:ro
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
    network_mode: "host"    #Using the host network
```

**datanode.yml：**

```Bash
#datanode.yml
version: "3"
services:
  iotdb-datanode:
    image: iotdb-enterprise:1.3.2.3-standalone #The image used
    hostname: iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
    container_name: iotdb-datanode
    command: ["bash", "-c", "entrypoint.sh datanode"]
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6667:6667"
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - dn_rpc_address=iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
      - dn_internal_address=iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
      - dn_seed_config_node=iotdb-1:10710      #The default first node is the seed node
      - dn_rpc_port=6667
      - dn_internal_port=10730
      - dn_mpp_data_exchange_port=10740
      - dn_schema_region_consensus_port=10750
      - dn_data_region_consensus_port=10760
      - schema_replication_factor=3         #Number of metadata copies
      - data_replication_factor=2           #Number of data replicas
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/activation:/iotdb/activation
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /usr/sbin/dmidecode:/usr/sbin/dmidecode:ro
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
    network_mode: "host"   #Using the host network
```

### 3.4 Start ConfigNode for the First Time

Start the ConfigNode on all 3 servers. **Note the startup order**: Start `iotdb-1` first, followed by `iotdb-2` and `iotdb-3`.

Run the following command on each server:

```Bash
cd　/docker-iotdb
docker-compose -f confignode.yml up  -d #Background startup
```

### 3.5 Start DataNode

Start the DataNode on all 3 servers: 

```Bash
cd /docker-iotdb
docker-compose  -f  datanode.yml  up -d #Background startup
```

![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%882.png)

### 3.6  Verify Deployment

- Check the logs: If you see the following message, the DataNode has started successfully.

    ```SQL
    docker logs -f iotdb-datanode #View log command
    2024-07-21 09:40:58,120 [main] INFO  o.a.i.db.service.DataNode:227 - Congratulations, IoTDB DataNode is set up successfully. Now, enjoy yourself!
    ```

    ![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%883.png)

- Enter the container and check the service status:

    View the launched container

    ```SQL
    docker ps
    ```

    ![](/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%884.png)

    Enter any container, log in to the database via CLI, and use the `show cluster` command to check the service status:

    ```SQL
    docker exec -it iotdb-datanode /bin/bash #Entering the container
    ./start-cli.sh -h iotdb-1                #Log in to the database
    IoTDB> show cluster                      #View status
    ```

    If all services are in the `running` state, the IoTDB deployment is successful.

### 3.7 Map the `/conf` Directory (Optional)

If you want to modify configuration files directly on the physical machine, you can map the `/conf` folder from the container. Follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Copy the `/conf` directory from the container to `/docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf` on all 3 servers:

```Bash
docker cp iotdb-confignode:/iotdb/conf /docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf
or
docker cp iotdb-datanode:/iotdb/conf   /docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf 
```

**Step 2**: Add the `/conf` directory mapping in both `confignode.yml` and `datanode.yml` on all 3 servers:

```bash
#confignode.yml
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/conf:/iotdb/conf  #Add mapping for this /conf folder
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro

#datanode.yml
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/conf:/iotdb/conf   #Add mapping for this /conf folder
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
```

**Step 3**: Restart IoTDB on all 3 servers:

```bash
cd /docker-iotdb
docker-compose  -f confignode.yml  up  -d
docker-compose  -f datanode.yml    up  -d
```
