# Benchmark Tool

## 1. **Basic Overview**

IoT-benchmark is a time-series database benchmarking tool developed in Java for big data environments. It was developed and open-sourced by the School of Software, Tsinghua University. The tool is user-friendly, supports various write and query methods, allows storing test information and results for further queries or analysis, and integrates with Tableau for visualizing test results.

Figure 1-1 illustrates the test benchmark process and its extended functionalities, all of which can be streamlined by IoT-benchmark. It supports a variety of workloads, including write-only, read-only, and mixed write-and-read operations. Additionally, it offers software and hardware system monitoring, performance metric measurement, automated database initialization, test data analysis, and system parameter optimization.

Figure 1-1 *IoT-benchmark Test Benchmark Process*

IoT-benchmark adopts the modular design concept of the YCSB test tool, which separates workload generation, performance measurement, and database interface components. Its modular structure is illustrated in Figure 1-2. Unlike YCSB-based testing tools, IoT-benchmark introduces a system monitoring module that supports the persistence of both test data and system metrics. It also includes load-testing functionalities specifically designed for time-series data scenarios, such as batch writes and multiple out-of-order data insertion modes for IoT environments.

**Supported Databases**

Currently, IoT-benchmark supports the following time series databases, versions and connection methods:

| Database        | Version    | Connection mmethod                                       |

### 2.4 **Execution** **of** **Tests**

1. Modify the configuration file (conf/config.properties) according to test requirements. For example, to test Apache IoTDB 2.0, set the following parameter:

   ```Bash
      DB_SWITCH=IoTDB-200-SESSION_BY_TABLET
      ```

2. Ensure the target time-series database is running.

3. Start IoT-benchmark to execute the test. Monitor the status of both the target database and IoT-benchmark during execution.

4. Upon completion, review the results and analyze the test process.

### 2.5 **Results Interpretation**

All test log files are stored in the `logs` folder, while test results are saved in the `data/csvOutput` folder. For example, the following result matrix illustrates the test outcome:

![](/img/bm4.png)

- **Result Matrix:**
  - OkOperation: Number of successful operations.
  - OkPoint: Number of successfully written points (for write operations) or successfully queried points (for query operations).
  - FailOperation: Number of failed operations.
  - FailPoint: Number of failed write points.
- **Latency (ms) Matrix:**
  - AVG: Average operation latency.
  - MIN: Minimum operation latency.
  - Pn: Quantile values of the overall operation distribution (e.g., P25 represents the 25th percentile, or lower quartile).

## 3. **Main** **Parameters**

### 3.1 IoTDB Service Model

The `IoTDB_DIALECT_MODE` parameter supports two modes: `tree` and `table`. The default value is `tree`.

- **For IoTDB 2.0 and later versions**, the `IoTDB_DIALECT_MODE` parameter must be specified, and only one mode can be set for each IoTDB instance.
- **IoTDB_DIALECT_MODE = tree:**
  - The number of devices must be greater than or equal to the number of databases.

### 3.2 **Working** **Mode**

The `BENCHMARK_WORK_MODE` parameter supports four operational modes:

1. **General Test Mode (****`testWithDefaultPath`****):** Configured via the `OPERATION_PROPORTION` parameter to support write-only, read-only, and mixed read-write operations.
2. **Data Generation Mode (****`generateDataMode`****):** Generates a reusable dataset, which is saved to `FILE_PATH` for subsequent use in the correctness write and correctness query modes.
3. **Single Database Correctness Write Mode (****`verificationWriteMode`****):** Verifies the correctness of dataset writing by writing the dataset generated in data generation mode. This mode supports only IoTDB v1.0+ and InfluxDB v1.x.
4. **Single Database Correctness Query Mode (****`verificationQueryMode`****):** Verifies the correctness of dataset queries after using the correctness write mode. This mode supports only IoTDB v1.0+ and InfluxDB v1.x.

Mode configurations are shown in the following below:

| **Mode name**                          | **BENCHMARK_WORK_MODE** | Description                                             | Required Configuration     |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| General test mode                      | testWithDefaultPath     | Supports multiple read and write mixed load operations. | `OPERATION_PROPORTION`     |
| Generate data mode                     | generateDataMode        | Generates datasets recognizable by IoT-benchmark.       | `FILE_PATH` and `DATA_SET` |
| Single database correctness write mode | verificationWriteMode   | Writes datasets for correctness verification.           | `FILE_PATH` and `DATA_SET` |
| Single database correctness query mode | verificationQueryMode   | Queries datasets to verify correctness.                 | `FILE_PATH` and `DATA_SET` |

### 3.7 **Test process and test result persistence**

IoT-benchmark currently supports persisting the test process and test results through configuration parameters.

| **Parameter**         | **Type** | **Example** | D**escription**                                              |
| :-------------------- | :------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| TEST_DATA_PERSISTENCE | String   | `None`      | Specifies the result persistence method. Options: `None`, `IoTDB`, `MySQL`, `CSV`. |
| RECORD_SPLIT          | Boolean  | `true`      | Whether to split results into multiple records. (Not supported by IoTDB currently.) |
| RECORD_SPLIT_MAX_LINE | Integer  | `10000000`  | Maximum number of rows per record (10 million rows per database table or CSV file). |
| TEST_DATA_STORE_IP    | String   | `127.0.0.1` | IP address of the database for result storage.               |
| TEST_DATA_STORE_PORT  | Integer  | `6667`      | Port number of the output database.                          |
| TEST_DATA_STORE_DB    | String   | `result`    | Name of the output database.                                 |
| TEST_DATA_STORE_USER  | String   | `root`      | Username for accessing the output database.                  |
| TEST_DATA_STORE_PW    | String   | `root`      | Password for accessing the output database.                  |

**Result Persistence Details**

- **CSV Mode:** If `TEST_DATA_PERSISTENCE` is set to `CSV`, a `data` folder is generated in the IoT-benchmark root directory during and after test execution. This folder contains:
  - `csv` folder: Records the test process.
  - `csvOutput` folder: Stores the test results.
- **MySQL Mode:** If `TEST_DATA_PERSISTENCE` is set to `MySQL`, IoT-benchmark creates the following tables in the specified MySQL database:
  - **Test Process Table:**
    1. Created before the test starts.
    2. Named as: `testWithDefaultPath_<database_name>_<remarks>_<test_start_time>`.
  - **Configuration Table:**
    1. Named `CONFIG`.
    2. Stores the test configuration.
    3. Created if it does not exist.
  - **Final Result Table:**
    1. Named `FINAL_RESULT`.
    2. Stores the test results after test completion.
    3. Created if it does not exist.

### 3.8  Automation Script

#### One-Click Script Startup

The `cli-benchmark.sh` script allows one-click startup of IoTDB, IoTDB Benchmark monitoring, and IoTDB Benchmark testing. However, please note that this script will clear all existing data in IoTDB during startup, so use it with caution.

**Steps to Run:**

1. Edit the `IOTDB_HOME` parameter in `cli-benchmark.sh` to the local IoTDB directory.
2. Start the test by running the following command:

```Bash
> ./cli-benchmark.sh
```

1. After the test completes:
  1. Check test-related logs in the `logs` folder.
  2. Check monitoring-related logs in the `server-logs` folder.

#### Automatic Execution of Multiple Tests

Single tests are often insufficient without comparative results. Therefore, IoT-benchmark provides an interface for executing multiple tests in sequence.

1. **Routine Configuration:** Each line in the `routine` file specifies the parameters that change for each test. For example:

   ```Plain
      LOOP=10 DEVICE_NUMBER=100 TEST
      LOOP=20 DEVICE_NUMBER=50 TEST
      LOOP=50 DEVICE_NUMBER=20 TEST
      ```

In this example, three tests will run sequentially with `LOOP` values of 10, 20, and 50.

Then the test process with 3 LOOP parameters of 10, 20, and 50 is executed in sequence.

**Important Notes:**

- Multiple parameters can be changed in each test using the format:

  ```Bash
    LOOP=20 DEVICE_NUMBER=10 TEST
    ```

- Avoid unnecessary spaces.

- The `TEST` keyword marks the start of a new test.

- Changed parameters persist across subsequent tests unless explicitly reset.

2. **Start the Test:** After configuring the `routine` file, start multi-test execution using the following command

   ```Bash
      > ./rep-benchmark.sh
      ```

Test results will be displayed in the terminal.

**Important Notes:**

- Closing the terminal or losing the client connection will terminate the test process.

- To run the test as a background daemon, execute:

  ```Bash
    > ./rep-benchmark.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    ```

- To monitor progress, check the logs:

  ```Bash
    > cd ./logs
    > tail -f log_info.log
    ```

## 4. Use Case

We take the application of CRRC Qingdao Sifang Vehicle Research Institute Co., Ltd. as an example, and refer to the scene described in "Apache IoTDB in Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Platform Storage" for practical operation instructions.

Test objective: Simulate the actual needs of switching time series databases in the scene of CRRC Qingdao Sifang Institute, and compare the performance of the expected IoTDB and KairosDB used by the original system.

Test environment: In order to ensure that the impact of other irrelevant services and processes on database performance and the mutual influence between different databases are eliminated during the experiment, the local databases in this experiment are deployed and run on multiple independent virtual servers with the same resource configuration. Therefore, this experiment set up 4 Linux (CentOS7 /x86) virtual machines, and deployed IoT-benchmark, IoTDB database, KairosDB database, and MySQL database on them respectively. The specific resource configuration of each virtual machine is shown in Table 4-1. The specific usage of each virtual machine is shown in Table 4-2.

### 4.1 Write Test

Scenario description: Create 100 clients to simulate 100 trains, each train has 3000 sensors, the data type is DOUBLE, the data time interval is 500ms (2Hz), and they are sent sequentially. Referring to the above requirements, we need to modify the IoT-benchmark configuration parameters as listed in Table 4-3.

First, start the tested time series databases Apache-IoTDB and KairosDB on 172.21.4.3 and 172.21.4.4 respectively, and then start server resource monitoring through the ser-benchamrk\.sh script on 172.21.4.2, 172.21.4.3 and 172.21.4.4 (Figure 4-1). Then modify the conf/config.properties files in the iotdb-0.13-0.0.1 and kairosdb-0.0.1 folders in 172.21.4.2 according to Table 4-3 to meet the test requirements. Use benchmark\.sh to start the writing test of Apache-IoTDB and KairosDB successively.

Figure 4-1 Server monitoring tasks

For example, if we first start the test on KairosDB, IoT-benchmark will create a CONFIG data table in the MySQL database to store the configuration information of this test (Figure 4-2), and there will be a log output of the current test progress during the test execution (Figure 4-3) . When the test is completed, the test result will be output (Figure 4-3), and the result will be written into the FINAL_RESULT data table (Figure 4-4).

Figure 4-4 Test result table

Afterwards, we will start the test on Apache-IoTDB. The same IoT-benchmark will write the test configuration information in the MySQL database CONFIG data table. During the test execution, there will be a log to output the current test progress. When the test is completed, the test result will be output, and the result will be written into the FINAL_RESULT data table.

According to the test result information, we know that under the same configuration the write delay times of Apache-IoTDB and KairosDB are 55.98ms and 1324.45ms respectively; the write throughputs are 5,125,600.86 points/second and 224,819.01 points/second respectively; the tests were executed respectively 585.30 seconds and 11777.99 seconds. And KairosDB has a write failure. After investigation, it is found that the data disk usage has reached 100%, and there is no disk space to continue receiving data. However, Apache-IoTDB has no write failure, and the disk space occupied after all data is written is only 4.7G (as shown in Figure 4-5); Apache-IoTDB is better than KairosDB in terms of write throughput and disk occupation. Of course, there will be other tests in the follow-up to observe and compare from various aspects, such as query performance, file compression ratio, data security, etc.

So what is the resource usage of each server during the test? What is the specific performance of each write operation? At this time, we can visualize the data in the server monitoring table and test process recording table by installing and using Tableau. The use of Tableau will not be introduced in this article. After connecting to the data table for test data persistence, the specific results are as follows (taking Apache-IoTDB as an example):

### 4.3 Description of Other Parameters

In the previous chapters, the write performance comparison between Apache-IoTDB and KairosDB was performed, but if the user wants to perform a simulated real write rate test, how to configure it? How to control if the test time is too long? Are there any regularities in the generated simulated data? If the IoT-Benchmark server configuration is low, can multiple machines be used to simulate pressure output?
