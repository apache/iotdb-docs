| alias             | Example of named plugin                                               |                                                              |
| interval          |Collect the frequency of this indicator. Ordinary plugins use a single global interval, but if the running frequency of a specific input should be lower or higher, you can configure it here` Interval can be increased to reduce data input rate limitations.  |                                                              |
| precision         | Overlay the settings of the 'precision' proxy. The collected indicators are rounded to the specified precision interval. When this value is set on the service input (e.g. `'statsd':`), the output database may merge multiple events that occur at the same timestamp. |                                                              |

### 4.3 Start Telegraf Service

```Bash
telegraf -config /path/to/telegraf.conf
```

## 5、Example Usage

The following is an example of collecting CPU data using Telegraf and outputting it to IoTDB using Telegraf IoTDB. Generate configuration files using the telegraf command

```Bash
telegraf --sample-config --input-filter cpu --output-filter iotdb > cpu_iotdb.conf
```

1. Modify the configuration of the input CPU plugin in cpu_iotdb. conf. Among them, the "name_ooverride" field is the custom time-series path name used when outputting to IoTDB

```Bash
# Read metrics about cpu usage
[[inputs.cpu]]
  ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
  percpu = true
  ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
  totalcpu = true
  ## If true, collect raw CPU time metrics
  collect_cpu_time = false
  ## If true, compute and report the sum of all non-idle CPU states
  report_active = false
  ## If true and the info is available then add core_id and physical_id tags
  core_tags = false
  name_override = "root.demo.telgraf.cpu"
```

2. Modify the configuration of the output iotdb plugin in cpu_iotdb. conf

| Configuration              | Description           | Before Modification                              | After Modification                                            | Notes                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| host                | Host of IoTDB  | # host = "127.0.0.1"                | host = "Deploy IoTDB host"                       | Default is 127.0.0.1                                             |
| port                | The port number of IoTDB | # port = "6667"                     | port = "Port number for deploying IoTDB"                      | Default is 6667                                                  |
| user                | Username for IoTDB | # user = "root"                     | user = "Username for IoTDB"                           |Default as root                                                  |
| password            | Password for IoTDB | # password = "root"                 | password= "Password for IoTDB"                        | Default as root                                                  |
| timestamp_precision | Timestamp accuracy     | timestamp_precision = "millisecond" | timestamp_precision = "Same timestamp accuracy as IoTDB" | You can check the 'timestamp-precision' field in 'iotdb system. properties' |
| sanitize_tag        | Database version     | none                                  | sanitize_tag = "0.13/1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3"             |                                                              |

```Bash
# Save metrics to an IoTDB Database
[[outputs.iotdb]]
  ## Configuration of IoTDB server connection
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  # port = "6667"

  ## Configuration of authentication
  # user = "root"
  # password = "root"

  ## Timeout to open a new session.
  ## A value of zero means no timeout.
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Configuration of type conversion for 64-bit unsigned int
  ## IoTDB currently DOES NOT support unsigned integers (version 13.x).
  ## 32-bit unsigned integers are safely converted into 64-bit signed integers by the plugin,
  ## however, this is not true for 64-bit values in general as overflows may occur.
  ## The following setting allows to specify the handling of 64-bit unsigned integers.
  ## Available values are:
  ##   - "int64"       --  convert to 64-bit signed integers and accept overflows
  ##   - "int64_clip"  --  convert to 64-bit signed integers and clip the values on overflow to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  ##   - "text"        --  convert to the string representation of the value
  # uint64_conversion = "int64_clip"

  ## Configuration of TimeStamp
  ## TimeStamp is always saved in 64bits int. timestamp_precision specifies the unit of timestamp.
  ## Available value:
  ## "second", "millisecond", "microsecond", "nanosecond"(default)
  timestamp_precision = "millisecond"

  ## Handling of tags
  ## Tags are not fully supported by IoTDB.
  ## A guide with suggestions on how to handle tags can be found here:
  ##     https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/API/InfluxDB-Protocol.html
  ##
  ## Available values are:
  ##   - "fields"     --  convert tags to fields in the measurement
  ##   - "device_id"  --  attach tags to the device ID
  ##
  ## For Example, a metric named "root.sg.device" with the tags `tag1: "private"`  and  `tag2: "working"` and
  ##  fields `s1: 100`  and `s2: "hello"` will result in the following representations in IoTDB
  ##   - "fields"     --  root.sg.device, s1=100, s2="hello", tag1="private", tag2="working"
  ##   - "device_id"  --  root.sg.device.private.working, s1=100, s2="hello"
  # convert_tags_to = "device_id"
   ## Handling of unsupported characters
  ## Some characters in different versions of IoTDB are not supported in path name
  ## A guide with suggetions on valid paths can be found here:
  ## for iotdb 0.13.x           -> https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V0.13.x/Reference/Syntax-Conventions.html#identifiers
  ## for iotdb 1.x.x and above  -> https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V1.3.x/User-Manual/Syntax-Rule.html#identifier
  ##
  ## Available values are:
  ##   - "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", "1.3"  -- enclose in `` the world having forbidden character
  ##                                    such as @ $ # : [ ] { } ( ) space
  ##   - "0.13"                      -- enclose in `` the world having forbidden character
  ##                                    such as space
  ##
  ## Keep this section commented if you don't want to sanitize the path
  sanitize_tag = "1.3"
```

3. Run Telegraf using the cpu_iotdb.exe configuration file: After running for a period of time, the data collected and reported by Telegraf can be queried in IoTDB
