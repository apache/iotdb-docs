# Data Sync

Data synchronization is a typical requirement in industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Through data synchronization mechanisms, it is possible to achieve data sharing between IoTDB, and to establish a complete data link to meet the needs for internal and external network data interconnectivity, edge-cloud synchronization, data migration, and data backup.

## Function Overview

### Data Synchronization

A data synchronization task consists of three stages:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/sync_en_01.png)

- Source Stage：This part is used to extract data from the source IoTDB, defined in the source section of the SQL statement.
- Process Stage：This part is used to process the data extracted from the source IoTDB, defined in the processor section of the SQL statement.
- Sink Stage：This part is used to send data to the target IoTDB, defined in the sink section of the SQL statement.

By declaratively configuring the specific content of the three parts through SQL statements, flexible data synchronization capabilities can be achieved. Currently, data synchronization supports the synchronization of the following information, and you can select the synchronization scope when creating a synchronization task (the default is data.insert, which means synchronizing newly written data):

<table style="text-align: left;">
  <tbody>
     <tr>            <th>Synchronization Scope</th>
            <th>Synchronization Content	</th>        
            <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
            <td colspan="2">all</td>  
            <td>All scopes</td> 
      </tr>
      <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">data（Data）</td>
            <td>insert</td>
            <td>Synchronize newly written data</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
            <td>delete</td>
            <td>Synchronize deleted data</td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">schema</td>
            <td>database</td>
            <td>Synchronize database creation, modification or deletion operations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
            <td>timeseries</td>
            <td>Synchronize the definition and attributes of time series</td>       
      </tr>
      <tr>
            <td>TTL</td>
            <td>Synchronize the data retention time</td>       
      </tr>
      <tr>
            <td>auth</td>
            <td>-</td>       
            <td>Synchronize user permissions and access control</td>
      </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Functional limitations and instructions

The schema and auth synchronization functions have the following limitations:

- When using schema synchronization, it is required that the consensus protocol for `Schema region` and `ConfigNode`  must be the default ratis protocol. This means that the `iotdb-system.properties` configuration file should contain the settings `config_node_consensus_protocol_class=org.apache.iotdb.consensus.ratis.RatisConsensus` and `schema_region_consensus_protocol_class=org.apache.iotdb.consensus.ratis.RatisConsensus`. If these are not specified, the default ratis protocol is used.

- To prevent potential conflicts, please disable the automatic creation of schema on the receiving end when enabling schema synchronization. This can be done by setting the `enable_auto_create_schema` configuration in the `iotdb-system.properties` file to false.

- When schema synchronization is enabled, the use of custom plugins is not supported.

- In a dual-active cluster, schema synchronization should avoid simultaneous operations on both ends.

- During data synchronization tasks, please avoid performing any deletion operations to prevent inconsistent states between the two ends.

## Usage Instructions

Data synchronization tasks have three states: RUNNING, STOPPED, and DROPPED. The task state transitions are shown in the following diagram:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/Data-Sync02.png)

After creation, the task will start directly, and when the task stops abnormally, the system will automatically attempt to restart the task.

Provide the following SQL statements for state management of synchronization tasks.

### Create Task

Use the `CREATE PIPE` statement to create a data synchronization task. The `PipeId` and `sink` attributes are required, while `source` and `processor` are optional. When entering the SQL, note that the order of the `SOURCE` and `SINK` plugins cannot be swapped.

The SQL example is as follows:

```SQL
CREATE PIPE [IF NOT EXISTS] <PipeId> -- PipeId is the name that uniquely identifies the task.
-- Data extraction plugin, optional plugin
WITH SOURCE (
  [<parameter> = <value>,],
)
-- Data processing plugin, optional plugin
WITH PROCESSOR (
  [<parameter> = <value>,],
)
-- Data connection plugin, required plugin
WITH SINK (
  [<parameter> = <value>,],
)
```

**IF NOT EXISTS semantics**: Used in creation operations to ensure that the create command is executed when the specified Pipe does not exist, preventing errors caused by attempting to create an existing Pipe.

### Start Task

Start processing data:

```SQL
START PIPE<PipeId>
```

### Stop Task

Stop processing data:

```SQL
STOP PIPE <PipeId>
```

###  Delete Task

Deletes the specified task:

```SQL
DROP PIPE [IF EXISTS] <PipeId>
```
**IF EXISTS semantics**: Used in deletion operations to ensure that when a specified Pipe exists, the delete command is executed to prevent errors caused by attempting to delete non-existent Pipes.

Deleting a task does not require stopping the synchronization task first.

### View Task

View all tasks:

```SQL
SHOW PIPES
```

To view a specified task:

```SQL
SHOW PIPE <PipeId>
```

Example of the show pipes result for a pipe:

```SQL
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
|                              ID|           CreationTime|  State|PipeSource|PipeProcessor|                                                   PipeSink|ExceptionMessage|RemainingEventCount|EstimatedRemainingSeconds|
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
|59abf95db892428b9d01c5fa318014ea|2024-06-17T14:03:44.189|RUNNING|        {}|           {}|{sink=iotdb-thrift-sink, sink.ip=127.0.0.1, sink.port=6668}|                |                128|                     1.03|
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
```

The meanings of each column are as follows:

- **ID**：The unique identifier for the synchronization task
- **CreationTime**：The time when the synchronization task was created
- **State**：The state of the synchronization task
- **PipeSource**：The source of the synchronized data stream
- **PipeProcessor**：The processing logic of the synchronized data stream during transmission
- **PipeSink**：The destination of the synchronized data stream
- **ExceptionMessage**：Displays the exception information of the synchronization task
- **RemainingEventCount (Statistics with Delay)**: The number of remaining events, which is the total count of all events in the current data synchronization task, including data and schema synchronization events, as well as system and user-defined events.
- **EstimatedRemainingSeconds (Statistics with Delay)**: The estimated remaining time, based on the current number of events and the rate at the pipe, to complete the transfer.

### Synchronization Plugins

To make the overall architecture more flexible to match different synchronization scenario requirements, we support plugin assembly within the synchronization task framework. The system comes with some pre-installed common plugins that you can use directly. At the same time, you can also customize processor plugins and Sink plugins, and load them into the IoTDB system for use. You can view the plugins in the system (including custom and built-in plugins) with the following statement:

```SQL
SHOW PIPEPLUGINS
```

The return result is as follows (version 1.3.2):

```SQL

## Use examples

### Full data synchronisation

This example is used to demonstrate the synchronisation of all data from one IoTDB to another IoTDB with the data link as shown below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe1.jpg)

In this example, we can create a synchronization task named A2B to synchronize the full data from A IoTDB to B IoTDB. The iotdb-thrift-sink plugin (built-in plugin) for the sink is required. The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB needs to be configured through node-urls, as shown in the following example statement:

```SQL
create pipe A2B
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668',  -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
```

### Partial data synchronization

This example is used to demonstrate the synchronisation of data from a certain historical time range (8:00pm 23 August 2023 to 8:00pm 23 October 2023) to another IoTDB, the data link is shown below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe2.jpg)

In this example, we can create a synchronization task named A2B. First, we need to define the range of data to be transferred in the source. Since the data being transferred is historical data (historical data refers to data that existed before the creation of the synchronization task), we need to configure the start-time and end-time of the data and the transfer mode mode. The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB needs to be configured through node-urls.

The detailed statements are as follows:

```SQL
create pipe A2B
WITH SOURCE (
  'source'= 'iotdb-source',
  'realtime.mode' = 'stream' -- The extraction mode for newly inserted data (after pipe creation)
  'start-time' = '2023.08.23T08:00:00+00:00',  -- The start event time for synchronizing all data, including start-time
  'end-time' = '2023.10.23T08:00:00+00:00'  -- The end event time for synchronizing all data, including end-time
) 
with SINK (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-async-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
```

### Bidirectional data transfer

This example is used to demonstrate the scenario where two IoTDB act as active-active pairs, with the data link shown in the figure below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe3.jpg)

In this example, to avoid infinite data loops, the `forwarding-pipe-requests` parameter on A and B needs to be set to `false`, indicating that data transmitted from another pipe is not forwarded, and to keep the data consistent on both sides, the pipe needs to be configured with `inclusion=all` to synchronize full data and metadata.

The detailed statement is as follows:

On A IoTDB, execute the following statement:

```SQL
create pipe AB
with source (
  'inclusion'='all',  -- Indicates synchronization of full data, schema , and auth
  'forwarding-pipe-requests' = 'false'   -- Do not forward data written by other Pipes
)
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
```

On B IoTDB, execute the following statement:

```SQL
create pipe BA
with source (
  'inclusion'='all',   -- Indicates synchronization of full data, schema , and auth
  'forwarding-pipe-requests' = 'false'   -- Do not forward data written by other Pipes
)
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6667', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
```

### Edge-cloud data transfer

This example is used to demonstrate the scenario where data from multiple IoTDB is transferred to the cloud, with data from clusters B, C, and D all synchronized to cluster A, as shown in the figure below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/sync_en_03.png)

In this example, to synchronize the data from clusters B, C, and D to A, the pipe between BA, CA, and DA needs to configure the `path` to limit the range, and to keep the edge and cloud data consistent, the pipe needs to be configured with `inclusion=all` to synchronize full data and metadata. The detailed statement is as follows:

On B IoTDB, execute the following statement to synchronize data from B to A:

```SQL
create pipe BA
with source (
   'inclusion'='all',   -- Indicates synchronization of full data, schema , and auth
   'path'='root.db.**', -- Limit the range
)
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
)
```

On C IoTDB, execute the following statement to synchronize data from C to A:

```SQL
create pipe CA
with source (
   'inclusion'='all',  -- Indicates synchronization of full data, schema , and auth
   'path'='root.db.**', -- Limit the range
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
)
```

On D IoTDB, execute the following statement to synchronize data from D to A:

```SQL
create pipe DA
with source (
   'inclusion'='all',  -- Indicates synchronization of full data, schema , and auth
   'path'='root.db.**', -- Limit the range
)
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
)
```

### Cascading data transfer

This example is used to demonstrate the scenario where data is transferred in a cascading manner between multiple IoTDB, with data from cluster A synchronized to cluster B, and then to cluster C, as shown in the figure below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/sync_en_04.png)

In this example, to synchronize the data from cluster A to C, the `forwarding-pipe-requests` needs to be set to `true` between BC. The detailed statement is as follows:

On A IoTDB, execute the following statement to synchronize data from A to B:

```SQL
create pipe AB
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
)
```

On B IoTDB, execute the following statement to synchronize data from B to C:

```SQL
create pipe BC
with source (
  'forwarding-pipe-requests' = 'true'   -- Whether to forward data written by other Pipes
)
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6669', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
)
)
```

### Cross-gate data transfer

This example is used to demonstrate the scenario where data from one IoTDB is synchronized to another IoTDB through a unidirectional gateway, as shown in the figure below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe5.jpg)


In this example, the iotdb-air-gap-sink plugin in the sink task needs to be used . After configuring the gateway, execute the following statement on A IoTDB. Fill in the node-urls with the URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB configured by the gateway, as detailed below:

```SQL
create pipe A2B
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-air-gap-sink',
  'node-urls' = '10.53.53.53:9780', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
```
**Notes: Currently supported gateway models**

 XL—GAP    | No Limit            | No Limit               |

### Compression Synchronization (V1.3.3+)

IoTDB supports specifying data compression methods during synchronization. Real time compression and transmission of data can be achieved by configuring the `compressor` parameter. `Compressor` currently supports 5 optional algorithms: snappy/gzip/lz4/zstd/lzma2, and can choose multiple compression algorithm combinations to compress in the order of configuration `rate-limit-bytes-per-second`(supported in V1.3.3 and later versions) is the maximum number of bytes allowed to be transmitted per second, calculated as compressed bytes. If it is less than 0, there is no limit.

For example, to create a synchronization task named A2B:

```SQL
create pipe A2B 
with sink (
 'node-urls' = '127.0.0.1:6668', -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
 'compressor' = 'snappy,lz4'  -- Compression algorithms
)
```

### Encrypted Synchronization (V1.3.1+)

IoTDB supports the use of SSL encryption during the synchronization process, ensuring the secure transfer of data between different IoTDB instances. By configuring SSL-related parameters, such as the certificate address and password （`ssl.trust-store-path`）、（`ssl.trust-store-pwd`）, data can be protected by SSL encryption during the synchronization process.

For example, to create a synchronization task named A2B:

```SQL
create pipe A2B
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-ssl-sink',
  'node-urls'='127.0.0.1:6667',  -- The URL of the data service port of the DataNode node on the target IoTDB
  'ssl.trust-store-path'='pki/trusted',  -- The trust store certificate path required to connect to the target DataNode
  'ssl.trust-store-pwd'='root' -- The trust store certificate password required to connect to the target DataNode
)
```

## Reference: Notes

You can adjust the parameters for data synchronization by modifying the IoTDB configuration file （`iotdb-system.properties`）, such as the directory for storing synchronized data. The complete configuration is as follows:

V1.3.3+:

```Properties
# pipe_receiver_file_dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/${cn_system_dir}/pipe/receiver).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in the exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If pipe_receiver_file_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# effectiveMode: restart

>
> 💎  **Explanation: Differences between Stream and Batch Data Extraction Modes**
> - **stream (recommended)**: In this mode, tasks process and send data in real-time. It is characterized by high timeliness and low throughput.
> - **batch**: In this mode, tasks process and send data in batches (according to the underlying data files). It is characterized by low timeliness and high throughput.
