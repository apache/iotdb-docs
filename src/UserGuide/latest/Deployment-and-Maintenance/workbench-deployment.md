## Installation Steps

### Step 1: IoTDB enables monitoring indicator collection

1. Open the monitoring configuration item. The configuration items related to monitoring in IoTDB are disabled by default. Before deploying the monitoring panel, you need to open the relevant configuration items (note that the service needs to be restarted after enabling monitoring configuration).

    <table>
        <tr>
                <th>Configuration</th>
                <th>Located in the configuration file</th>        
                <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>cn_metric_reporter_list</td>   
                <td rowspan="3">conf/iotdb-confignode.properties</td> 
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to PROMETHEUS</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>cn_metric_level</td>   
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to IMPORTANT</td> 
        </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>cn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port</td>   
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item to maintain the default setting of 9091. If other ports are set, they will not conflict with each other</td> 
        </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>dn_metric_reporter_list</td>   
                <td rowspan="4">conf/iotdb-datanode.properties</td> 
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to PROMETHEUS</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>dn_metric_level</td>   
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to IMPORTANT</td> 
        </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>dn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port</td>   
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set it to 9092 by default. If other ports are set, they will not conflict with each other</td> 
        </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>dn_metric_internal_reporter_type</td>   
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to IOTDB</td> 
        </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>enable_audit_log</td>   
                <td rowspan="3">conf/iotdb-common.properties</td> 
                <td>Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to true</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>audit_log_storage</td>   
                <td>Uncomment configuration items</td> 
        </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>audit_log_operation</td>   
                <td>Uncomment configuration items</td> 
        </tr>
    </table>


2. Restart all nodes. After modifying the monitoring indicator configuration of three nodes, the confignode and datanode services of all nodes can be restarted:

    ```shell
    ./sbin/stop-standalone.sh      #Stop confignode and datanode first
    ./sbin/start-confignode.sh  -d #Start confignode
    ./sbin/start-datanode.sh  -d   #Start datanode 
    ```

3. After restarting, confirm the running status of each node through the client. If the status is Running, it indicates successful configuration:

### Step 2: Install and configure Prometheus

1. Download the Prometheus installation package, which requires installation of V2.30.3 and above. You can go to the Prometheus official website to download it (https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/)
2. Unzip the installation package and enter the unzipped folder:

    ```Shell
    tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
    cd prometheus-*
    ```

3.  Modify the configuration. Modify the configuration file prometheus.yml as follows
    1.  Add configNode task to collect monitoring data for ConfigNode
    2.  Add a datanode task to collect monitoring data for DataNodes

    ```shell
    global:
    scrape_interval: 15s 
    evaluation_interval: 15s 
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "prometheus"
        static_configs:
        - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
    - job_name: "confignode"
        static_configs:
        - targets: ["iotdb-1:9091","iotdb-2:9091","iotdb-3:9091"]
        honor_labels: true
    - job_name: "datanode"
        static_configs:
        - targets: ["iotdb-1:9092","iotdb-2:9092","iotdb-3:9092"]
        honor_labels: true
    ```

4. Start Prometheus. The default expiration time for Prometheus monitoring data is 15 days. In production environments, it is recommended to adjust it to 180 days or more to track historical monitoring data for a longer period of time. The startup command is as follows:

    ```Shell
    ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.retention.time=180d
    ```

5. Confirm successful startup. Enter in browser `http://IP:port` Go to Prometheus and click on the Target interface under Status. When you see that all States are Up, it indicates successful configuration and connectivity.
