## Storage (Disk)
### Storage space
Calculation formula: Number of measurement points * Sampling frequency (Hz) * Size of each data point (Byte, different data types may vary, see table below) * Storage time (seconds) * Number of copies (usually 1 copy for a single node and 2 copies for a cluster) รท Compression ratio (can be estimated at 5-10 times, but may be higher in actual situations)

Example: 1000 devices, each with 100 measurement points, a total of 100000 sequences, INT32 type. Sampling frequency 1Hz (once per second), storage for 1 year, 3 copies.
- Complete calculation formula: 1000 devices * 100 measurement points * 12 bytes per data point * 86400 seconds per day * 365 days per year * 3 copies/10 compression ratio=11T
- Simplified calculation formula: 1000 * 100 * 12 * 86400 * 365 * 3/10=11T
### Storage Configuration
If the number of nodes is over 10000000 or the query load is high, it is recommended to configure SSD
## Other instructions
IoTDB has the ability to scale up clusters in seconds, and expanding node data does not require migration. Therefore, you do not need to worry about the limited cluster capacity estimated based on existing data. In the future, you can add new nodes to the cluster when you need to scale up.
