# Docker Deployment

## Environmental Preparation

### 1.Docker Installation

```SQL
#Taking Ubuntu as an example, other operating systems can search for installation methods themselves
#step1: Install some necessary system tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
#step2: Install GPG certificate
curl -fsSL https://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
#step3: Write software source information
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
#step4: Update and install Docker CE
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce
#step5: Set Docker to start automatically upon startup
sudo systemctl enable docker
#step6： Verify if Docker installation is successful
docker --version  #Display version information, indicating successful installation
```

### 2. Docker-compose Installation

```SQL
#Installation command
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ln -s  /usr/local/bin/docker-compose  /usr/bin/docker-compose
#Verify if the installation was successful
docker-compose --version  #Displaying version information indicates successful installation
```

## Stand-Alone Deployment

This section demonstrates how to deploy a standalone Docker version of 1C1D.

### 1. Pull Image File

The Docker image of Apache IoTDB has been uploaded tohttps://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iotdb。

Taking obtaining version 1.3.2 as an example, pull the image command:

```bash
docker pull apache/iotdb:1.3.2-standalone
```

View image:

```bash
docker images
```

### 2. Create Docker Bridge Network

```Bash
docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 --gateway=172.18.0.1  iotdb
```

### 3. Write The Yml File For Docker-Compose

Here we take the example of consolidating the IoTDB installation directory and yml files in the/docker iotdb folder:

The file directory structure is:`/docker-iotdb/iotdb`, `/docker-iotdb/docker-compose-standalone.yml `

```bash
docker-iotdb：
├── iotdb  #Iotdb installation directory
│── docker-compose-standalone.yml #YML file for standalone Docker Composer
```

The complete docker-compose-standalone.yml content is as follows:

```bash
version: "3"
services:
  iotdb-service:
    image: apache/iotdb:1.3.2-standalone #The image used
    hostname: iotdb
    container_name: iotdb
    restart: always       
    ports:
      - "6667:6667"
    environment:
      - cn_internal_address=iotdb
      - cn_internal_port=10710
      - cn_consensus_port=10720
      - cn_seed_config_node=iotdb:10710
      - dn_rpc_address=iotdb
      - dn_internal_address=iotdb
      - dn_rpc_port=6667
      - dn_internal_port=10730
      - dn_mpp_data_exchange_port=10740
      - dn_schema_region_consensus_port=10750
      - dn_data_region_consensus_port=10760
      - dn_seed_config_node=iotdb:10710
    privileged: true
    volumes:
        - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
        - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
        - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
    networks:
      iotdb:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.6
networks:
  iotdb:
    external: true
```

### 4. Start IoTDB

Use the following command to start:

```bash
cd　/docker-iotdb
docker-compose -f docker-compose-standalone.yml up  -d  #Background startup
```

### 5. Validate Deployment

- Viewing the log, the following words indicate successful startup

```SQL
docker logs -f iotdb-datanode #View log command
2024-07-21 08:22:38,457 [main] INFO  o.a.i.db.service.DataNode:227 - Congratulations, IoTDB DataNode is set up successfully. Now, enjoy yourself!
```

- Enter the container to view the service running status and activation information 

View the launched container

```SQL
docker ps
```

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%AA%8C%E8%AF%81%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B22.png)

Enter the container, log in to the database through CLI, and use the `show cluster` command to view the service status and activation status

```SQL
docker exec -it iotdb   /bin/bash        #Entering the container
./start-cli.sh -h iotdb                  #Log in to the database
IoTDB> show cluster                      #View status
```

You can see that all services are running and the activation status shows as activated.

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%AA%8C%E8%AF%81%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B23.png)

### 6.  Map/conf Directory (optional)

If you want to directly modify the configuration file in the physical machine in the future, you can map the/conf folder in the container in three steps:

Step 1: Copy the /conf directory from the container to `/docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf`

```bash
docker cp iotdb:/iotdb/conf /docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf
```

Step 2: Add mappings in docker-compose-standalone.yml

```bash
    volumes:
        - ./iotdb/conf:/iotdb/conf   #Add mapping for this/conf folder
        - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
        - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
        - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
```

Step 3: Restart IoTDB

```bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose-standalone.yml  up  -d
```

## Cluster Deployment

This section describes how to manually deploy an instance that includes 3 Config Nodes and 3 Data Nodes, commonly known as a 3C3D cluster.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/20240705141552.png" alt="" style="width: 60%;"/>
</div>

**Note: The cluster version currently only supports host and overlay networks, and does not support bridge networks.**

Taking the host network as an example, we will demonstrate how to deploy a 3C3D cluster.

### 1.Set Host Name

Assuming there are currently three Linux servers, the IP addresses and service role assignments are as follows:

| Node IP     | Host Name | Service              |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 192.168.1.3 | iotdb-1   | ConfigNode、DataNode |
| 192.168.1.4 | iotdb-2   | ConfigNode、DataNode |
| 192.168.1.5 | iotdb-3   | ConfigNode、DataNode |

Configure the host names on three machines separately. To set the host names, configure `/etc/hosts` on the target server using the following command:

```Bash
echo "192.168.1.3  iotdb-1"  >> /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.4  iotdb-2"  >> /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.5  iotdb-3"  >> /etc/hosts 
```

### 2. Pull Image File

The Docker image of Apache IoTDB has been uploaded tohttps://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iotdb。

Pull IoTDB images from three servers separately, taking version 1.3.2 as an example. The pull image command is:

```SQL
docker pull apache/iotdb:1.3.2-standalone
```

View image:

```SQL
docker images
```

### 3.Write The Yml File For Docker Compose

Here we take the example of consolidating the IoTDB installation directory and yml files in the `/docker-iotdb` folder:

The file directory structure is :`/docker-iotdb/iotdb`,  `/docker-iotdb/confignode.yml`，`/docker-iotdb/datanode.yml`

```SQL
docker-iotdb：
├── confignode.yml #Yml file of confignode
├── datanode.yml   #Yml file of datanode
└── iotdb          #IoTDB installation directory
```

On each server, two yml files need to be written, namely confignnode. yml and datanode. yml. The example of yml is as follows:

**confignode.yml：**

```bash
#confignode.yml
version: "3"
services:
  iotdb-confignode:
    image: iotdb-enterprise:1.3.2.3-standalone #The image used
    hostname: iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
    container_name: iotdb-confignode
    command: ["bash", "-c", "entrypoint.sh confignode"]
    restart: always
    environment:
      - cn_internal_address=iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
      - cn_internal_port=10710
      - cn_consensus_port=10720
      - cn_seed_config_node=iotdb-1:10710   #The default first node is the seed node
      - schema_replication_factor=3         #Number of metadata copies
      - data_replication_factor=2           #Number of data replicas
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/activation:/iotdb/activation
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /usr/sbin/dmidecode:/usr/sbin/dmidecode:ro
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
    network_mode: "host"    #Using the host network
```

**datanode.yml：**

```bash
#datanode.yml
version: "3"
services:
  iotdb-datanode:
    image: iotdb-enterprise:1.3.2.3-standalone #The image used
    hostname: iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
    container_name: iotdb-datanode
    command: ["bash", "-c", "entrypoint.sh datanode"]
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6667:6667"
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - dn_rpc_address=iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
      - dn_internal_address=iotdb-1|iotdb-2|iotdb-3 #Choose from three options based on the actual situation
      - dn_seed_config_node=iotdb-1:10710      #The default first node is the seed node
      - dn_rpc_port=6667
      - dn_internal_port=10730
      - dn_mpp_data_exchange_port=10740
      - dn_schema_region_consensus_port=10750
      - dn_data_region_consensus_port=10760
      - schema_replication_factor=3         #Number of metadata copies
      - data_replication_factor=2           #Number of data replicas
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/activation:/iotdb/activation
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /usr/sbin/dmidecode:/usr/sbin/dmidecode:ro
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
    network_mode: "host"   #Using the host network
```

### 4. Starting Confignode For The First Time

First, start configNodes on each of the three servers to obtain the machine code. Pay attention to the startup order, start the first iotdb-1 first, then start iotdb-2 and iotdb-3.

```bash
cd　/docker-iotdb
docker-compose -f confignode.yml up  -d #Background startup
```

### 5. Start Datanode

Start datanodes on 3 servers separately

```SQL
cd /docker-iotdb
docker-compose  -f  datanode.yml  up -d #Background startup
```

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%882.png)

### 6. Validate Deployment

- Viewing the logs, the following words indicate that the datanode has successfully started

    ```SQL
    docker logs -f iotdb-datanode #View log command
    2024-07-21 09:40:58,120 [main] INFO  o.a.i.db.service.DataNode:227 - Congratulations, IoTDB DataNode is set up successfully. Now, enjoy yourself!
    ```

    ![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%883.png)

- Enter any container to view the service running status and activation information

    View the launched container

    ```SQL
    docker ps
    ```

    ![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90-%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%89%884.png)

    Enter the container, log in to the database through CLI, and use the `show cluster` command to view the service status and activation status

    ```SQL
    docker exec -it iotdb-datanode /bin/bash #Entering the container
    ./start-cli.sh -h iotdb-1                #Log in to the database
    IoTDB> show cluster                      #View status
    ```

    You can see that all services are running and the activation status shows as activated.

### 7. Map/conf Directory (optional)

If you want to directly modify the configuration file in the physical machine in the future, you can map the/conf folder in the container in three steps:

Step 1: Copy the `/conf` directory from the container to `/docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf` on each of the three servers

```bash
docker cp iotdb-confignode:/iotdb/conf /docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf
or
docker cp iotdb-datanode:/iotdb/conf   /docker-iotdb/iotdb/conf 
```

Step 2: Add `/conf` directory mapping in `confignode.yml` and `datanode. yml` on 3 servers

```bash
#confignode.yml
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/conf:/iotdb/conf  #Add mapping for this /conf folder
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro

#datanode.yml
    volumes:
      - ./iotdb/conf:/iotdb/conf   #Add mapping for this /conf folder
      - ./iotdb/data:/iotdb/data
      - ./iotdb/logs:/iotdb/logs
      - /dev/mem:/dev/mem:ro
```

Step 3: Restart IoTDB on 3 servers

```bash
cd /docker-iotdb
docker-compose  -f confignode.yml  up  -d
docker-compose  -f datanode.yml    up  -d
```
