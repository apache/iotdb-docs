## Overview

The significance of query analysis lies in assisting users to understand the execution mechanism and performance bottlenecks of queries, thereby achieving query optimization and performance improvement. This concerns not only the efficiency of query execution but also directly affects the user experience of applications and the effective use of resources. To conduct effective query analysis, IoTDB provides query analysis tools: Explain and Explain Analyze.

The Explain tool allows users to preview the execution plan of a query SQL, including how IoTDB organizes data retrieval and processing.

Explain Analyze goes further by adding performance analysis, fully executing the SQL and displaying the time and resources consumed during the execution of the query. It provides detailed information for IoTDB users to deeply understand query details and perform query optimization.
### Explain
The Explain command allows users to view the execution plan of an SQL query. The execution plan is presented in the form of operators, describing how IoTDB will execute the query. The output of Explain includes information such as data access strategies, whether filter conditions are pushed down, and the distribution of the query plan across different nodes, providing users with a means to visualize the internal logic of the query execution. Its syntax is as follows:

```sql
EXPLAIN <SELECT_STATEMENT>
```
Where SELECT_STATEMENT is the SQL statement related to the query. An example of usage is as follows:
```sql
insert into root.explain.data(timestamp, column1, column2) values(1710494762, "hello", "explain")

explain select * from root.explain.data
```
Execute the SQL and get the following result：
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                      distribution plan|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                         ┌───────────────────┐                         |
|                         │FullOuterTimeJoin-3│                         |
|                         │Order: ASC         │                         |
|                         └───────────────────┘                         |
|                 ┌─────────────────┴─────────────────┐                 |
|                 │                                   │                 |
|┌─────────────────────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐|
|│SeriesScan-4                     │ │SeriesScan-5                     │|
|│Series: root.explain.data.column1│ │Series: root.explain.data.column2│|
|│Partition: 3                     │ │Partition: 3                     │|
|└─────────────────────────────────┘ └─────────────────────────────────┘|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
It can be seen that IoTDB retrieves the data for column1 and column2 through two separate SeriesScan nodes, and finally connects them using fullOuterTimeJoin.
### Explain Analyze
Explain Analyze is a performance analysis SQL built into the IoTDB query engine. Unlike Explain, it executes the corresponding query plan and collects execution information. It can be used to track the specific performance distribution of a query, observe resources, and conduct performance tuning and anomaly analysis.

Compared to other analysis methods where can be attached in IoTDB, Explain Analyze does not require deployment effort and can analyze individual SQL statements, allowing for more precise problem identification:

|Method|Installation Difficulty|Impact on Business|Supports Distributed System|Analysis of Individual SQL|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Arthas Sampling|Requires downloading and running files on the machine: some internal networks cannot directly install Arthas; and sometimes, it requires restarting the application after installation|CPU sampling may affect the response speed of online business|No|Online businesses usually have various query loads, and the overall monitoring metrics and sampling results can only reflect the overall load and response times of all queries, unable to analyze the response time of individual slow SQL|
|Monitor Tool|Requires enabling monitoring services or deploying Grafana, and open-source users do not have a monitoring dashboard|Recording metrics will bring additional response time|Yes| Same as Arthas|
|Explain Analyze|No installation required, available upon starting IoTDB|Only affects the single query being analyzed, with no impact on other online loads|Yes|Allows for tracking and analysis of individual SQL statements|

Its syntax is as following：
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE [VERBOSE] <SELECT_STATEMENT>
```
In it, SELECT_STATEMENT corresponds to the query statement to be analyzed. By default, in order to simplify the results as much as possible, EXPLAIN ANALYZE will omit some information. Specifying VERBOSE can be used to output this information.

The result set of EXPLAIN ANALYZE will include the following information:

![image.png](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/image.png) 

QueryStatistics contains the statistical information at the query level, primarily including the time consumed during the plan parsing phase, Fragment metadata, and other information.

FragmentInstance is IoTDB's encapsulation of a query plan on a node. Each node will output a Fragment information in the result set, mainly including FragmentStatistics and operator information.

FragmentStatistics includes the statistical information of a Fragment, such as the total actual duration (wall-clock time), the TsFiles involved, scheduling information, etc. The information of a Fragment is also displayed in a tree hierarchy of plan nodes within that Fragment, including:
* CPU runtime
* Number of output rows
* Number of times a specific interface is called
* Memory usage
* Node-specific custom information

Below is an example of Explain Analyze:

```sql
insert into root.explain.analyze.data(timestamp, column1, column2, column3) values(1710494762, "hello", "explain", "analyze")
insert into root.explain.analyze.data(timestamp, column1, column2, column3) values(1710494862, "hello2", "explain2", "analyze2")
insert into root.explain.analyze.data(timestamp, column1, column2, column3) values(1710494962, "hello3", "explain3", "analyze3")
explain analyze select column2 from root.explain.analyze.data order by column1
```
Get result following:
```

#### PlanNode Compaction in the Result Of EXPLAIN ANALYZE    

![image-cyxm.png](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/image-cyxm.png)


In a Fragment, the information of all nodes executed in the current node will be output. However, when a query involves too many series, outputting each seriesScanNode can lead to an excessively large result set from Explain Analyze. Therefore, when the same type of nodes exceeds 10, all nodes of the same type under the current Fragment will be merged. The statistical information is also accumulated after the merge, and some customized information that cannot be merged will be directly discarded.

The threshold for triggering the merge of nodes can be set by modifying the configuration item `merge_threshold_of_explain_analyze` in iotdb-common.properties, and this parameter supports hot loading. Below is a part of the result example after triggering a merge:

#### Query Timeout Handling
Explain Analyze is a unique type of query. When it times out, we are unable to obtain the analysis results from the return. To address this, allowing for the investigation of timeout reasons through analysis results even in cases of timeout, Explain Analyze offers a timed logging mechanism. After certain intervals, the current results of Explain Analyze are output in text form to a dedicated log file. This way, when a query times out, one can go to the logs to investigate the corresponding log for troubleshooting.

The logging interval is calculated based on the query's timeout setting, ensuring that there are at least two records of results in case of a timeout.
