# Data Synchronisation
Data synchronisation is a typical requirement of industrial IoT. Through the data synchronisation mechanism, data sharing between IoTDBs can be achieved, and a complete data link can be built to meet the needs of intranet and extranet data interoperability, end-to-end cloud synchronisation, data migration, data backup, and so on.

## Introduction

### Synchronisation Task Overview

A data synchronisation task consists of 2 phases:

- Source phase: This part is used to extract data from the source IoTDB, which is defined in the source part of the SQL statement.
- Sink phase: This part is used to send data to the target IoTDB and is defined in the sink part of the SQL statement.



Flexible data synchronisation capabilities can be achieved by declaratively configuring the specifics of the 2 sections through SQL statements.

### Synchronisation Task - Create

Use the `CREATE PIPE` statement to create a data synchronisation task, the following attributes `PipeId` and `sink` are mandatory, `source` and `processor` are optional, when entering the SQL note that the order of the `SOURCE ` and `SINK` plugins are not interchangeable.

The SQL example is as follows:

```SQL
CREATE PIPE <PipeId> -- PipeId is the name that uniquely identifies the task.
-- Data Extraction Plugin, Required Plugin
WITH SOURCE (
  [<parameter> = <value>,],
)
-- Data connection plugin, required
WITH SINK (
  [<parameter> = <value>,], -- data connection plugin, required.
)
```
> ðŸ“Œ Note: To use the data synchronisation feature, make sure that automatic metadata creation is enabled on the receiving side



### Synchronisation Tasks - Management

The Data Synchronisation task has three states; RUNNING, STOPPED and DROPPED.The task state transitions are shown below:

![State Migration Diagram](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81%E8%BF%81%E7%A7%BB%E5%9B%BE.png)

A data synchronisation task passes through multiple states during its lifecycle:

- RUNNING: Running state.
  - Explanation 1: The initial state of the task is the running state(V1.3.1+).
- STOPPED: Stopped state.
  - Description 1: The initial state of the task is the stopped state(V1.3.0). A SQL statement is required to start the task.
  - Description 2: You can manually stop a running task with a SQL statement, and the state will change from RUNNING to STOPPED.
  - Description 3: When a task has an unrecoverable error, its status will automatically change from RUNNING to STOPPED.
- DROPPED: deleted state.

We provide the following SQL statements to manage the status of synchronisation tasks.

#### Starting a Task

After creation, the task will not be processed immediately, you need to start the task. Use the `START PIPE` statement to start the task so that it can begin processing data:

```Go
START PIPE<PipeId>
```

#### Stop the task

Stop processing data:

``` Go
STOP PIPE <PipeId>
```

#### Delete a task

Deletes the specified task:

``` Go
DROP PIPE <PipeId>
```
Deleting a task does not require you to stop synchronising the task first.
#### Viewing Tasks

View all tasks:

```Go
SHOW PIPES
```

To view a specified task:

```Go
SHOW PIPE <PipeId>.
```

### Plugin

In order to make the overall architecture more flexible to match different synchronisation scenarios, IoTDB supports plugin assembly in the above synchronisation task framework. Some common plugins are pre-built for you to use directly, and you can also customise sink plugins and load them into the IoTDB system for use.

| Modules          | Plugins       | Pre-configured Plugins                | Customised Plugins |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------| 
| Extract (Source) | Source Plugin | iotdb-source                          | Not Supported      |
| Send (Sink)      | Sink plugin   | iotdb-thrift-sink| Support            |

#### Preconfigured Plugins

The preset plugins are listed below:

| Plugin Name           | Type          | Introduction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Available Versions |

Detailed parameters for each plugin can be found in the [Parameter Description](#sink-parameters) section of this document.

#### View Plugins

To view the plugins in the system (including custom and built-in plugins) you can use the following statement:

```Go
SHOW PIPEPLUGINS
```

The following results are returned:

```Go

## Use examples

### Full data synchronisation

This example is used to demonstrate the synchronisation of all data from one IoTDB to another IoTDB with the data link as shown below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe1.jpg)

In this example, we can create a synchronisation task named A2B to synchronise the full amount of data from IoTDB A to IoTDB B. Here we need to use the iotdb-thrift-sink plugin (built-in plugin) which uses sink, and we need to specify the address of the receiving end, in this example, we have specified 'sink.ip' and 'sink.port', and we can also specify 'sink.port'. This example specifies 'sink.ip' and 'sink.port', and also 'sink.node-urls', as in the following example statement:

```Go
create pipe A2B
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink', 
  'sink.ip'='127.0.0.1',
  'sink.port'='6668'
)
```


### Synchronising historical data

This example is used to demonstrate the synchronisation of data from a certain historical time range (8:00pm 23 August 2023 to 8:00pm 23 October 2023) to another IoTDB, the data link is shown below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe2.jpg)

In this example we can create a synchronisation task called A2B. First of all, we need to define the range of data to be transferred in source, since the data to be transferred is historical data (historical data refers to the data that existed before the creation of the synchronisation task), we need to configure the source.realtime.enable parameter to false; at the same time, we need to configure the start-time and end-time of the data and the mode of the transfer. At the same time, you need to configure the start-time and end-time of the data and the mode of transmission, and it is recommended that the mode be set to hybrid mode (hybrid mode is a mixed transmission mode, which adopts the real-time transmission mode when there is no backlog of data, and adopts the batch transmission mode when there is a backlog of data, and automatically switches according to the internal situation of the system).

The detailed statements are as follows:

```SQL
create pipe A2B
WITH SOURCE (
'source'= 'iotdb-source',
'source.realtime.mode'='hybrid',
'source.history.start-time' = '2023.08.23T08:00:00+00:00',
'source.history.end-time' = '2023.10.23T08:00:00+00:00') 
with SINK (
'sink'='iotdb-thrift-async-sink',
'sink.node-urls'='xxxx:6668',
'sink.batch.enable'='false')
```


### Cascading Data Transfer


This example is used to demonstrate a cascading data transfer scenario between multiple IoTDBs, where data is synchronised from cluster A to cluster B and then to cluster C. The data link is shown in the figure below:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/upload/pipe4.jpg)

In this example, in order to synchronise the data from cluster A to C, the pipe between BC needs to be configured with `source.forwarding-pipe-requests` to `true`, the detailed statement is as follows:

Execute the following statement on A IoTDB to synchronise data from A to B:

```Go
create pipe AB
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'sink.ip'='127.0.0.1',
  'sink.port'='6668'
)
```

Execute the following statement on B IoTDB to synchronise data in B to C:

```Go
create pipe BC
with source (
  'source.forwarding-pipe-requests' = 'true',
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-thrift-sink',
  'sink.ip'='127.0.0.1',
  'sink.port'='6669'
)
```

## Reference: Notes

The IoTDB configuration file (iotdb-system.properties) can be modified in order to adjust the parameters for data synchronisation, such as the synchronisation data storage directory. The complete configuration is as follows:

V1.3.0+:
```Properties
####################
### Pipe Configuration

## Reference: parameter description
ðŸ“Œ Notes: for version 1.3.1 or later, any parameters other than "source", "processor", "sink" themselves need not be with the prefixes. For instance:
```Sql
create pipe A2B
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-air-gap-sink',
  'sink.ip'='10.53.53.53',
  'sink.port'='9780'
)
```
can be written as
```Sql
create pipe A2B
with sink (
  'sink'='iotdb-air-gap-sink',
  'ip'='10.53.53.53',
  'port'='9780'
)
```
