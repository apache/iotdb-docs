# Tiered Storage 
## 1. Overview

The Tiered storage functionality allows users to define multiple layers of storage, spanning across multiple types of storage media (Memory mapped directory, SSD, rotational hard discs or cloud storage). While memory and cloud storage is usually singular, the local file system storages can consist of multiple directories joined together into one tier. Meanwhile, users can classify data based on its hot or cold nature and store data of different categories in specified "tier". Currently, IoTDB supports the classification of hot and cold data through TTL (Time to live / age) of data.  When the data in one tier does not meet the TTL rules defined in the current tier, the data will be automatically migrated to the next tier.

## 2. Parameter Definition

To enable tiered storage in IoTDB, you need to configure the following aspects:

1. configure the data catalogue and divide the data catalogue into different tiers
2. configure the TTL of the data managed in each tier to distinguish between hot and cold data categories managed in different tiers.
3. configure the minimum remaining storage space ratio for each tier so that when the storage space of the tier triggers the threshold, the data of the tier will be automatically migrated to the next tier (optional).

The specific parameter definitions and their descriptions are as follows.

| Configuration                                    | Default                    | Description                                                          | Constraint                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

## 3. local tiered storag configuration example

The following is an example of a local two-level storage configuration.

```JavaScript
//Required configuration items
dn_data_dirs=/data1/data;/data2/data,/data3/data;
tier_ttl_in_ms=86400000;-1
dn_default_space_usage_thresholds=0.2;0.1
```

In this example, two levels of storage are configured, specifically:

| **tier** | **data path**                           | **data range**    | **threshold for minimum remaining disk space** |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| tier 1   | path 1：/data1/data                    | data for last 1 day | 20%                      |
| tier 2   | path 2：/data2/data path 2：/data3/data | data from 1 day ago  | 10%                      |

## 4. remote tiered storag configuration example

The following takes three-level storage as an example:

```JavaScript
//Required configuration items
dn_data_dirs=/data1/data;/data2/data,/data3/data;OBJECT_STORAGE
tier_ttl_in_ms=86400000;864000000;-1
dn_default_space_usage_thresholds=0.2;0.15;0.1
object_storage_type=AWS_S3
object_storage_bucket=iotdb
object_storage_region=<your_region>
object_storage_endpoiont=<your_endpoint>
object_storage_access_key=<your_access_key>
object_storage_access_secret=<your_access_secret>

// Optional configuration items
enable_path_style_access=false
remote_tsfile_cache_dirs=data/datanode/data/cache
remote_tsfile_cache_page_size_in_kb=20971520
remote_tsfile_cache_max_disk_usage_in_mb=53687091200
```

In this example, a total of three levels of storage are configured, specifically:

| **tier** | **data path**                           | **data range**                 | **threshold for minimum remaining disk space** |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| tier1   | path 1：/data1/data                    | data for last 1 day              | 20%                      |
| tier2   | path 1：/data2/data path 2：/data3/data | data from past 1 day to past 10 days | 15%                      |
| tier 3   |  S3 Cloud Storage         | Data older than 10 days        | 10%                           |
