# Environmental Requirement

To use IoTDB, you need to have:

* Java >= 1.8 (1.8, 11 to 17 have been verified. Please make sure the environment path has been set.)
* Maven >= 3.6 (if you want to install IoTDB by compiling the source code)
* Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid "too many open files" problem.
* (Optional) Set the somaxconn as 65535 to avoid "connection reset" error when the system is under high load.


> **# Linux** <br>`sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65535` <br>**# FreeBSD æˆ– Darwin** <br>`sudo sysctl -w kern.ipc.somaxconn=65535`
