# Overview

IoTDB Ecosystem Integration Bridges the Full Pipeline of Time-Series Data:
- Through data collection, it enables second-level device connectivity.
- Via data integration, it constructs cross-cloud pipelines.
- Leveraging programming frameworks, it accelerates business logic development.
- With computing engines, it accomplishes distributed processing.
- Through visualization and SQL development, it implements analytical strategies.
- Finally, by interfacing with IoT platforms, it achieves edge-cloud synergyâ€”building a complete intelligent closed loop from the physical world to digital decision-making.
