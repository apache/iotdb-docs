# Monitoring Panel Deployment

The IoTDB monitoring panel is one of the supporting tools for the IoTDB Enterprise Edition. It aims to solve the monitoring problems of IoTDB and its operating system, mainly including operating system resource monitoring, IoTDB performance monitoring, and hundreds of kernel monitoring indicators, in order to help users monitor the health status of the cluster, and perform cluster optimization and operation. This article will take common 3C3D clusters (3 Confignodes and 3 Datanodes) as examples to introduce how to enable the system monitoring module in an IoTDB instance and use Prometheus+Grafana to visualize the system monitoring indicators.

## Installation Preparation

1. Installing IoTDB: You need to first install IoTDB V1.0 or above Enterprise Edition. You can contact business or technical support to obtain
2. Obtain the IoTDB monitoring panel installation package: Based on the enterprise version of IoTDB database monitoring panel, you can contact business or technical support to obtain

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: IoTDB enables monitoring indicator collection

1. Open the monitoring configuration item. The configuration items related to monitoring in IoTDB are disabled by default. Before deploying the monitoring panel, you need to open the relevant configuration items (note that the service needs to be restarted after enabling monitoring configuration).

| **Configuration**                  | Located in the configuration file | **Description**                                              |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| cn_metric_reporter_list            | conf/iotdb-system.properties  | Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to PROMETHEUS |
| cn_metric_level                    | conf/iotdb-system.properties  | Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to IMPORTANT |
| cn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port | conf/iotdb-system.properties  | Uncomment the configuration item to maintain the default setting of 9091. If other ports are set, they will not conflict with each other |
| dn_metric_reporter_list            | conf/iotdb-system.properties    | Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to PROMETHEUS |
| dn_metric_level                    | conf/iotdb-system.properties    | Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to IMPORTANT |
| dn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port | conf/iotdb-system.properties    | Uncomment the configuration item and set it to 9092 by default. If other ports are set, they will not conflict with each other |
| dn_metric_internal_reporter_type   | conf/iotdb-system.properties    | Uncomment the configuration item and set the value to IOTDB  |

Taking the 3C3D cluster as an example, the monitoring configuration that needs to be modified is as follows:

| Node IP     | Host Name | Cluster Role | Configuration File Path          | Configuration                                                |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 192.168.1.3 | iotdb-1   | confignode   | conf/iotdb-system.properties | cn_metric_reporter_list=PROMETHEUS cn_metric_level=IMPORTANT cn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port=9091 |
| 192.168.1.4 | iotdb-2   | confignode   | conf/iotdb-system.properties | cn_metric_reporter_list=PROMETHEUS cn_metric_level=IMPORTANT cn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port=9091 |
| 192.168.1.5 | iotdb-3   | confignode   | conf/iotdb-system.properties | cn_metric_reporter_list=PROMETHEUS cn_metric_level=IMPORTANT cn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port=9091 |
| 192.168.1.3 | iotdb-1   | datanode     | conf/iotdb-system.properties   | dn_metric_reporter_list=PROMETHEUS dn_metric_level=IMPORTANT dn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port=9092 dn_metric_internal_reporter_type=IOTDB |
| 192.168.1.4 | iotdb-2   | datanode     | conf/iotdb-system.properties   | dn_metric_reporter_list=PROMETHEUS dn_metric_level=IMPORTANT dn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port=9092 dn_metric_internal_reporter_type=IOTDB |
| 192.168.1.5 | iotdb-3   | datanode     | conf/iotdb-system.properties   | dn_metric_reporter_list=PROMETHEUS dn_metric_level=IMPORTANT dn_metric_prometheus_reporter_port=9092 dn_metric_internal_reporter_type=IOTDB |

2. Restart all nodes. After modifying the monitoring indicator configuration of three nodes, the confignode and datanode services of all nodes can be restarted:

```Bash
./sbin/stop-standalone.sh      #Stop confignode and datanode first
./sbin/start-confignode.sh  -d #Start confignode
./sbin/start-datanode.sh  -d   #Start datanode 
```

3. After restarting, confirm the running status of each node through the client. If the status is Running, it indicates successful configuration:

### Step 2: Install and configure Prometheus

> Taking Prometheus installed on server 192.168.1.3 as an example.

1. Download the Prometheus installation package, which requires installation of V2.30.3 and above. You can go to the Prometheus official website to download it（https://prometheus.io/download）
2. Unzip the installation package and enter the unzipped folder:

```Shell
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*
```

3. Modify the configuration. Modify the configuration file prometheus.yml as follows
   1. Add configNode task to collect monitoring data for ConfigNode
   2. Add a datanode task to collect monitoring data for DataNodes

```YAML
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s 
  evaluation_interval: 15s 
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
  - job_name: "confignode"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["iotdb-1:9091","iotdb-2:9091","iotdb-3:9091"]
    honor_labels: true
  - job_name: "datanode"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["iotdb-1:9092","iotdb-2:9092","iotdb-3:9092"]
    honor_labels: true
```

4. Start Prometheus. The default expiration time for Prometheus monitoring data is 15 days. In production environments, it is recommended to adjust it to 180 days or more to track historical monitoring data for a longer period of time. The startup command is as follows:

```Shell
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.retention.time=180d
```

5. Confirm successful startup. Enter in browser http://192.168.1.3:9090 Go to Prometheus and click on the Target interface under Status. When you see that all States are Up, it indicates successful configuration and connectivity.

    </div>

6. Clicking on the left link in Targets will redirect you to web monitoring and view the monitoring information of the corresponding node:

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E7%9B%91%E6%8E%A7.png)

### Step 3: Install Grafana and configure the data source

> Taking Grafana installed on server 192.168.1.3 as an example.

1. Download the Grafana installation package, which requires installing version 8.4.2 or higher. You can go to the Grafana official website to download it（https://grafana.com/grafana/download）
2. Unzip and enter the corresponding folder

```Shell
tar -zxvf grafana-*.tar.gz
cd grafana-*
```

3. Start Grafana:

```Shell
./bin/grafana-server web 
```

4. Log in to Grafana. Enter in browser http://192.168.1.3:3000 (or the modified port), enter Grafana, and the default initial username and password are both admin.

5. Configure data sources. Find Data sources in Connections, add a new data source, and configure the Data Source to Prometheus

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE.png)

When configuring the Data Source, pay attention to the URL where Prometheus is located. After configuring it, click on Save&Test and a Data Source is working prompt will appear, indicating successful configuration

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F.png)

### Step 4: Import IoTDB Grafana Dashboards

1. Enter Grafana and select Dashboards:
