# Stand-Alone Deployment

## Matters Needing Attention

1. Before installation, ensure that the system is complete by referring to [System configuration](.\Environment-Requirements.md).

2. It is recommended to prioritize using 'hostname' for IP configuration during deployment, which can avoid the problem of modifying the host IP in the later stage and causing the database to fail to start. To set the host name, you need to configure/etc/hosts on the target server. For example, if the local IP is 192.168.1.3 and the host name is iotdb-1, you can use the following command to set the server's host name and configure IoTDB's' cn_internal-address' using the host name dn_internal_address、dn_rpc_address。

   ``` Shell
   echo "192.168.1.3  iotdb-1" >> /etc/hosts 
   ```

3. Some parameters cannot be modified after the first startup. Please refer to the "Parameter Configuration" section below for settings.

4. Whether in linux or windows, ensure that the IoTDB installation path does not contain Spaces and Chinese characters to avoid software exceptions.

## Installation Steps

### 3、Start ConfigNode

Enter the sbin directory of iotdb and start confignode

```Shell
./start-confignode.sh    -d      #The "- d" parameter will start in the background 
```

### 4、Start DataNode

Enter the sbin directory of iotdb and start datanode:

```Shell
cd sbin
./start-datanode.sh   -d   #The "- d" parameter will start in the background 
```

### 5、Verify Deployment

Can be executed directly/ Cli startup script in sbin directory:

```Shell
./start-cli.sh  -h  ip(local IP or domain name)  -p  port(6667)
```

After successful startup, the following interface will appear displaying successful installation of IOTDB.

After the successful installation interface appears, use the `show cluster` command to check the service running status

When the status is all running, it indicates that the service has started successfully

> The appearance of 'Activated (W)' indicates passive activation, indicating that this Config Node does not have a license file (or has not issued the latest license file with a timestamp). At this point, it is recommended to check if the license file has been placed in the license folder. If not, please place the license file. If a license file already exists, it may be due to inconsistency between the license file of this node and the information of other nodes. Please contact Tianmu staff to reapply.
