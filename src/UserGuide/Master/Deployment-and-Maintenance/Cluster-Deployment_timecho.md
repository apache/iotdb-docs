# Cluster Deployment

This section describes how to manually deploy an instance that includes 3 ConfigNodes and 3 DataNodes, commonly known as a 3C3D cluster.

## Note

1. It is recommended to prioritize using `hostname` for IP configuration during deployment, which can avoid the problem of modifying the host IP in the later stage and causing the database to fail to start. To set the host name, you need to configure /etc/hosts on the target server. For example, if the local IP is 192.168.1.3 and the host name is iotdb-1, you can use the following command to set the server's host name and configure the `cn_internal_address` and `dn_internal_address` of IoTDB using the host name.

   ``` shell
   echo "192.168.1.3  iotdb-1" >> /etc/hosts 
   ```

2. Some parameters cannot be modified after the first startup. Please refer to the "Parameter Configuration" section below for settings.
3. It is recommended to deploy a monitoring panel, which can monitor important operational indicators and keep track of database operation status at any time. The monitoring panel can be obtained by contacting the business department,The steps for deploying a monitoring panel can refer to:[Monitoring Panel Deployment](https://timecho.com/docs/UserGuide/latest/Deployment-and-Maintenance/Monitoring-panel-deployment.html)

## Preparation Steps

1. Prepare the IoTDB database installation package: iotdb enterprise- {version}-bin.zip（The installation package can be obtained from:[IoTDB-Package](https://www.timecho.com/docs/UserGuide/latest/Deployment-and-Maintenance/IoTDB-Package_timecho.html)）
2. Configure the operating system environment according to environmental requirements（The system environment configuration can be found in:[Environment Requirement](https://www.timecho.com/docs/UserGuide/latest/Deployment-and-Maintenance/Environment-Requirements.html)）

## Installation Steps

Assuming there are three Linux servers now, the IP addresses and service roles are assigned as follows:

| Node IP     | Host Name | Service              |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 192.168.1.3 | iotdb-1   | ConfigNode、DataNode |
| 192.168.1.4 | iotdb-2   | ConfigNode、DataNode |
| 192.168.1.5 | iotdb-3   | ConfigNode、DataNode |

### 1. Set Host Name

On three machines, configure the host names separately. To set the host names, configure `/etc/hosts` on the target server. Use the following command:

```Bash
echo "192.168.1.3  iotdb-1"  >> /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.4  iotdb-2"  >> /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.5  iotdb-3"  >> /etc/hosts 
```

### 2. Configuration

Unzip the installation package and enter the installation directory

```Plain
unzip  iotdb-enterprise-{version}-bin.zip
cd  iotdb-enterprise-{version}-bin
```

#### Environment script configuration

- `./conf/confignode-env.sh` configuration

### 3. Start ConfigNode

Start the first confignode of IoTDB-1 first, ensuring that the seed confignode node starts first, and then start the second and third confignode nodes in sequence

```Bash
cd sbin
./start-confignode.sh    -d      #"- d" parameter will start in the background
```

### 4. Activate Database

#### Method 1: Activate file copy activation

- After starting three confignode nodes in sequence, copy the `activation` folder of each machine and the `system_info` file of each machine to the Timecho staff;
- The staff will return the license files for each ConfigNode node, where 3 license files will be returned;
- Put the three license files into the `activation` folder of the corresponding ConfigNode node;

#### Method 2: Activate Script Activation

- Obtain the machine codes of three machines in sequence, enter the `sbin` directory of the installation directory, and execute the activation script `start activate.sh`:

    ```Bash
    cd sbin
    ./start-activate.sh
    ```

- The following information is displayed, where the machine code of one machine is displayed:

    ```Bash
    Please copy the system_info's content and send it to Timecho:
    Y17hFA0xRCE1TmkVxILuxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxW5P52KCccFMVeHTc=
    Please enter license:
    ```

- The other two nodes execute the activation script `start activate.sh` in sequence, and then copy the machine codes of the three machines obtained to the Timecho staff
- The staff will return 3 activation codes, which normally correspond to the order of the provided 3 machine codes. Please paste each activation code into the previous command line prompt `Please enter license:`, as shown below:

    ```Bash
    Please enter license:
    Jw+MmF+Atxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx5bAOXNeob5l+HO5fEMgzrW8OJPh26Vl6ljKUpCvpTiw==
    License has been stored to sbin/../activation/license
    Import completed. Please start cluster and excute 'show cluster' to verify activation status
    ```

### 5. Start DataNode

 Enter the `sbin` directory of iotdb and start three datanode nodes in sequence:

```Bash
cd sbin
./start-datanode.sh   -d   #"- d" parameter will start in the background
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

Can be executed directly Cli startup script in `./sbin`  directory:

```Plain
./start-cli.sh  -h  ip(local IP or domain name)  -p  port(6667)
```

   After successful startup, the following interface will appear displaying successful installation of IOTDB.

![](https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E7%89%88%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F.png)

After the installation success interface appears, continue to check if the activation is successful and use the `show cluster`  command.

When you see the display of `Activated` on the far right, it indicates successful activation.
