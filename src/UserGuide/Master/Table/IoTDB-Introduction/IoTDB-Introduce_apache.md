# Product Introduction

Apache IoTDB is a low-cost, high-performance IoT-native time-series database. It addresses challenges faced by enterprises in managing time-series data for IoT big data platforms, including complex application scenarios, massive data volumes, high sampling frequencies, frequent out-of-order data, time-consuming data processing, diverse analytical requirements, and high storage and maintenance costs.

Key components include:

1. **Time-Series Database (Apache IoTDB)**: The core component for time-series data storage, offering high compression, rich query capabilities, real-time stream processing, high availability, and scalability. It provides security guarantees, configuration tools, multi-language APIs, and integration with external systems for building business applications.
2. **Time-Series File Format (Apache TsFile)**: A specialized storage format for time-series data, enabling efficient storage and querying. TsFile underpins IoTDB and AINode, unifying data management across collection, storage, and analysis phases.
3. **Time-Series Model Training-Inference Engine (IoTDB AINode)**: A unified engine for intelligent analysis, supporting model training, data management, and integration with machine/deep learning frameworks.
