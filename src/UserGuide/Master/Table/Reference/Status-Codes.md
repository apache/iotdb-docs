IoTDB introduces the concept of status codes. For example, since IoTDB needs to register a time series before writing data, one possible solution is:

```Plain
try {
    writeData();
} catch (SQLException e) {
  // the most case is that the time series does not exist
  if (e.getMessage().contains("exist")) {
      //However, using the content of the error message is not so efficient
      registerTimeSeries();
      //write data once again
      writeData();
  }
}
```

By utilizing status codes, we can avoid writing code such as `if (e.getErrorMessage().contains("exist"))` . Instead, we only need to use `e.getStatusType().getCode() == TSStatusCode.TIME_SERIES_NOT_EXIST_ERROR.getStatusCode()`.

Here is a list of status codes and their corresponding messages:

> In the latest version, we have refactored the exception classes in IoTDB. By consolidating error messages into the exception classes and assigning unique error codes to each exception, when an exception is caught and a higher-level exception is thrown, the error code is preserved and propagated. This allows users to understand the detailed cause of the error.
>
> Additionally, we have introduced a base exception class named `ProcessException`, which serves as the parent class for all other exceptions.
