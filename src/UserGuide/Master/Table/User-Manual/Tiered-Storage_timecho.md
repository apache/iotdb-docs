## Overview

The **tiered storage** feature enables users to manage multiple types of storage media efficiently. Users can configure different storage media types within IoTDB and classify them into distinct storage tiers. In IoTDB, tiered storage is implemented by managing multiple directories. Users can group multiple storage directories into the same category and designate them as a **storage tier**. Additionally, data can be classified based on its "hotness" or "coldness" and stored accordingly in designated tiers.

Currently, IoTDB supports hot and cold data classification based on the **Time-To-Live (****TTL****)** parameter. When data in a tier no longer meets the defined TTL rules, it is automatically migrated to the next tier.

## **Parameter Definitions**

To enable multi-level storage in IoTDB, the following configurations are required:

1. Configure data directories and assign them into different tiers
2. Set TTL for each Tier to distinguish hot and cold data managed by different tiers.
3. Configure minimum remaining storage space ratio for each tier (Optional). If the available space in a tier falls below the defined threshold, data will be migrated to the next tier automatically.

The specific parameter definitions and their descriptions are as follows.

| **Parameter**                              | **Default Value**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Constraints**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Local Tiered Storage Example

The following is an example of a **two-tier local storage configuration**:

```Properties
# Mandatory configurations
dn_data_dirs=/data1/data;/data2/data,/data3/data
tier_ttl_in_ms=86400000;-1
dn_default_space_usage_thresholds=0.2;0.1
```

**Tier Details:**

| **Tier** | **Storage Directories**      | **Data Range**        | **Remaining Space Threshold** |
| :------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Tier 1   | `/data1/data`                | Last 1 day of data    | 20%                           |
| Tier 2   | `/data2/data`, `/data3/data` | Data older than 1 day | 10%                           |

## Cloud-based Tiered Storage Example

The following is an example of a **three-tier configuration with cloud storage**:

```Properties
# Mandatory configurations
dn_data_dirs=/data1/data;/data2/data,/data3/data;OBJECT_STORAGE
tier_ttl_in_ms=86400000;864000000;-1
dn_default_space_usage_thresholds=0.2;0.15;0.1
object_storage_type=AWS_S3
object_storage_bucket=iotdb
object_storage_endpoiont=<your_endpoint>
object_storage_access_key=<your_access_key>
object_storage_access_secret=<your_access_secret>

# Optional configurations
remote_tsfile_cache_dirs=data/datanode/data/cache
remote_tsfile_cache_page_size_in_kb=20971520
remote_tsfile_cache_max_disk_usage_in_mb=53687091200
```

**Tier Details:**

| **Tier** | **Storage Directories**      | **Data Range**                 | **Remaining Space Threshold** |
| :------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Tier 1   | `/data1/data`                | Last 1 day of data             | 20%                           |
| Tier 2   | `/data2/data`, `/data3/data` | Data from 1 day to 10 days ago | 15%                           |
| Tier 3   | AWS S3 Cloud Storage         | Data older than 10 days        | 10%                           |
