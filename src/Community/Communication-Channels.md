# Communication Channels

Apache IoTDB engages with users and developers through multiple channels, ensuring open communication and community participation. Below are the ways you can interact with us, get support, and contribute to the project.

## 1. Mailing Lists

The mailing list is Apache's designated channel for communication among open-source contributors. It serves as the primary platform for discussing community plans, roadmaps, and announcements.

- Guide to Subscribingï¼š

  - To Subscribe: Send an email to <dev-subscribe@iotdb.apache.org>. The subject of the email does not matter.

  - To Confirm Subscription: After the initial subscription email, you will receive a confirmation email from an address ending in `iotdb.apache.org`. Simply reply to this email without changing the subject to complete your subscription.

- Other Mailing Lists:

  - JIRA Notifications: <notifications@iotdb.apache.org> (receives all JIRA notifications. You don't need to subscribe if you're only interested in specific JIRA issues; just follow or comment on the issue directly.)
  - Code Commit Notifications: <commits@iotdb.apache.org> (notifies all code changes. This list receives a high volume of emails.)
  - Code Review Notifications: <reviews@iotdb.apache.org> (notifies all code review comments. This list also receives a high volume of emails.)
