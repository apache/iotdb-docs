## Usage of the term "IoTDB" in projects and product names:

Apache IoTDB, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache IoTDB project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.

Organizations developing products and projects with Apache IoTDB and creating associated marketing materials should adhere to the trademark guidelines for "Apache IoTDB" and its logo. For comprehensive and authoritative guidance on correct trademark usage, please refer to the [ASF Trademarks Guidance](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) and associated [FAQ](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/).
It is recommended not to include “IoTDB” in any name to prevent potential trademark issues with the IoTDB project.

To avoid potential trademark issues, it is advised not to include "IoTDB" directly in any product names. For instance, "IoTDB BigDataProduct" is inappropriate because it contains "IoTDB." However, exceptions such as "BigDataProduct, powered by Apache IoTDB" or "BigDataProduct for Apache IoTDB" are acceptable, as they incorporate the full "Apache IoTDB" name. For software identifiers like Maven coordinates or module names, using formats like "iotdb-tool" is permissible. Nominative use of trademarks in descriptions is also allowed, e.g., "BigDataProduct is a submodule for Apache IoTDB".
